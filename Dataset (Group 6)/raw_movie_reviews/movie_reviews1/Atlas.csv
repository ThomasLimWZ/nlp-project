"6","I was expecting a far worse movie, but I was entertained","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9806548/?ref_=tt_urv","bwgood77","24 May 2024","Seeing Atlas starring Jennifer Lopez pop up on Netflix doesn't necessarily leave you with a lot of hope that it's going to be a good movie, but I surprisingly liked it much more than I expected.It may not start off particularly strong, but it gets going and I feel Jennifer Lopez did a better job acting than I expected, and I do remember her doing fairly well at times, like in Out of Sight.Anyway, it really gets going after about 20-30 minutes, and the action is very well done in my opinion and fun to watch. Think Halo but even more action at it's best. She doesn't trust AI but slowly learns to trust the AI she is forced to work with and develops a bond that grows throughout, and I enjoyed that.I think many Netflix movies get unfairly rated poorly and of course anything starring JLo will as well. As usual, it wouldn't surprise me if the very low ratings came from people who didn't even watch it. I really don't feel if I was going to give something a 4 or lower, I would even continuing watching it and didn't feel I could give a fair review (unless I was in a theater with friends or family and had to sit through a movie I hated).Anyway, if you like action and sci fi, and go in for some fun not expecting some masterpiece, I think you will definitely be entertained."
"6","Not as Bad as some has said...","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9808605/?ref_=tt_urv","datcherson","25 May 2024","Was it great no!!! Will it hold a spot in the Sci-fi Hall of Fame No!! But Did it hold me and Family attention for 2hr sure did.. The CGI was top notch, story was nothing new,but in today's world where AI is real thing you feal a little bit closer to the story than say 40 years ago when Terminator came out..Jlo is no Ripley from Aliens but she tried.. The back and forth between her and Smith was entertaining. Everyone is entitled to there opinions but to say this movie is Trash just because Jlo is in it, is crazy . And Simu Lui who plays Harlen the ""Bad Guy"" did a good job also. Don't let some of these reviews stop from watching a Decent chilling at home on the couch with some popcorn movie.."
"7","Far from perfect, but surprisingly entertaining!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9807758/?ref_=tt_urv","benjaminprins","25 May 2024","If you are a sci-fi fan and are known with the Titanfall game series, this movie will be very surprising. It is yet another take on the 'ai will take over the world'. But since I am a big fan of the Titanfall series it was great to experience a movie that was set unintentionally in the world of Titanfall. Jennifer Lopez would not have been my first choice to star in this type of movie, but I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised by her acting. The relationship between ai and humans got very well portrayed by Jennifer. I even almost shed a tear in the end of the movie. Having said this, I would say that there is a lot of untapped potential. It was a good experience, but it could have been amazing with a more compelling story and build up. The story felt a bit clich√© at moments but the CGI partly made up for this."
"6","Wrong lead but decent CGI","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9809786/?ref_=tt_urv","Tomaslillebror","26 May 2024","I kept asking myself throughout the movie wether Jennifer Lopes character was adapted for her or if Jennifer Lopes adapted to the character.The story is that there is a war between humanity and a rogue AI. We get to follow Jennifer Lopes character attempting to destroy the rogue AI.There is a lot of dialogue between what is portraited as the good AI and Jennifer Lopes character and this is where the problem happen in my opinion. Her character is so immature, entitled and emotional that it ruins the movie. This is because it isnt believable that someone of high intellect would act like that and its just annoyying to watch.The dialogue between Jennifer Lopes character and the good AI also seems like an advertisement for AI because the movie is portraiting the good AI as a loyal human friend.The best part of the movie is Mark Strongs acting and character. He has a small role but does it well.The CGI is great and camera, music and sound is just fine. So you will experience some nice sci fi watching this.6/10 For the CGI."
"3","Had potential but destroyed by JL's over acting","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9812141/?ref_=tt_urv","chursyheli","27 May 2024","**Movie Review: Atlas**Alright, let's talk about ""Atlas."" The graphics are absolutely banging, and the action scenes? Properly nailed it. You're on the edge of your seat, loving every punch and explosion. The storyline, though, is a bit meh. Nothing to write home about, really.Now, here's the kicker: Jennifer's acting. Blimey, it's a disaster. She's overacting like there's no tomorrow, and it just ruins the whole vibe. It's so over the top, you can't take any of the serious bits seriously. It's a real shame because everything else was looking pretty decent.So, in a nutshell, ""Atlas"" is a bit of a mixed bag. Great visuals and action, but the story's just alright, and Jennifer's performance? Total rubbish. If you're splashing out on a big project, make sure the acting doesn't muck it all up."
"4","Why do they keep giving Brad Peyton money?","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9806254/?ref_=tt_urv","darrenn","24 May 2024","Brad Peyton seems to be another one of these directors that Hollywood keeps throwing money at for mediocre formulaic movies, almost certainly written with AI now, trading on big star names & flashy soulless CGI. Jennifer Lopez is still just an average actor I hate to say, propped up by better actors around her. Using AI as a plot device has already been done so much better in movies since the 80's, but is now mostly just boring. It's easy to see all the movies Peyton is trying to pay homage to, but it's usually in the laziest way possible. The excessive time of Lopez alone in her mech suit, clearly just hours of her, green screen, & the director trying to come up with remotely interesting dialogue, is truly a test of endurance to watch. This movie will be forgotten within months."
"6","The six is for effects","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9806032/?ref_=tt_urv","pensman","24 May 2024","The writers latch onto a current concern: what happens if AI develops to a point where it decides it's time for us to go and it's bye-bye humanity. The special effects are good and I like imaginings of what the future will look like and what I will miss out on, unless maganuts destroy everything first.I assume most who decided to watch Atlas did so because they like a good sci-fi space opera and wanted to see how Jenny from the block is holding up.There isn't a lot new here as plot goes: madman (mad robot, same thing) is determined to kill everyone except for a few chosen; heroine is off to stop him. And plot twist (not really), heroine finds soul mate.The film is pretty much a one woman show as Ms. Lopez is on camera 100 per cent of the time. As she has to work in a confined space for much of the film, acting as such is how well Ms. Lopez can use her voice to create mood and sense of urgency. Basically a decent pop corn flic."
"2","Why oh why...","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9812296/?ref_=tt_urv","barbosa_antonio","27 May 2024","A good idea was laid to waste by such poor acting. It was painful to watch Jenifer Lopez... ""pain"" (grimace) for the duration of the whole movie... walking as if she had a stick on her legs and back (apparently it is how a ""tough"" girl walks?) was there no other emotion for the whole movie?The whole environment felt like a game rather than a real life/alien environment.It felt hollow, empty, rushed, but lots effort to do... what?Why would you destroy a good story with kid gimmicks, frag fest and a horrible actress? Keep her to the rom com where she was ok?I am even struggling to put this together..."
"8","Why was Jennifer Lopez casted in this movie? but in the end she is not that bad","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9805931/?ref_=tt_urv","kaefab","24 May 2024","Why was Jennifer Lopez casted in this movie? But in the end she is not that bad.I am not sure why people are giving the movie a bad rating and saying its bad, first off the special effects are quit good, I just finish watching Parasyte the grey and those were bad effects.Lopez actually pulls it off, she is not like invincible or anything she uses her intelligence instead of her strength combine with Adam the mech they are a great team.Atlas is far better than Rebel Moon at least part 2, and is a great mech sci fin movie in the end its entertaining even with the 2 hour length.If you like sci fi and good FX give this movie a chance honest, I almost skip it due to all those bad reviews, its clearly not a 10 but it does not deserve a 1 and certainly not all the hate it getting."
"7","Surprisingly entertained","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9808397/?ref_=tt_urv","sheilaodonovan-71594","25 May 2024","I often leave the cinema if I'm not enjoying the film. It's supposed to be entertaining, right? So, I actually enjoyed this movie. It was an easy watch, I didn't feel patronised, or spend any time wondering what the hell was going on. I was entertained.The storyline was engaging, JLo is a pretty versatile actress, as long as the character is easy on the eye and uncomplicated. Tick, tick. I liked the repartee between Smith and Atlas. The graphics were fine, the fight scenes weren't overly in your face, there were no animals, so no animals were hurt, and the vegetation was interesting. And I think Mark Strong is quietly cool."
"7","Not as bad as described","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9808709/?ref_=tt_urv","horstbegerak","25 May 2024","I had fun watching it. It is not Aliens, but it is good enough for an evening having dinner. I like Jennifer Lopez on screen. I enjoyed her in Out of Sight and Shades of Blue. She got better with the years and strong but difficult characters seems to fit her.For me Atlas had some flavor of ""Outer Limits"". The dialogs between her and Smith are funny and that a strong AI comes to the conclusion that the problems humans have are not solvable because humans are the problem is not out of the thinkable ideas.Tricks are enjoyable and the action is believable. It is to mention that she is not a skinny superfighter who knocks out 10 grown up and trained men."
"2","This Is Not I-Robot","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9805482/?ref_=tt_urv","TMAuthor23","24 May 2024","For those wondering how Jennifer Lopez managed to get cast in the lead role for this film, a role she is completely wrong for...she produced it.Without giving one specific plot point away, it's only necessary to compare this to the Will Smith I-Robot film to know what it's about.In I-Robot, an imperfect movie, but a box office smash, there was a damaged protagonist who hated AI (robots) and allowed it to cloud his thinking and consume his life and career. When an existential threat of true AI dominance arises, threatening human extinction, the protagonist bonds with an AI cohort, and fends off the uprising and destroys the AI central threat.This movie really wanted to be that movie, except in space with a female lead. There is real thing in Hollywood: you can steal a story if you change several key aesthetics. So, here we are.There are a lot of other problems. The most visible of which is Lopez. She's the kind of actress who some time ago encountered the nadir that many actors do: her status as a celebrity eclipsed her stature as an actress, and she began performing in a very packaged and self conscious way. When you can tell an actor is thinking about how they look in a film, that's not good.The other challenges? When a lead performer is as polarizing as Lopez there are many who will ""hate watch"" this, rubbing their hands together in anticipation of the imminent schadenfreude.It's further complicated that the director, Peyton (Andreas), is familiar enough with spectacle, but not masterful in putting together something that should be of epic scale.Add to those obstacles the glaringly apparent lack of originality in the script or character beats, and you have a patient that is Dead On Arrival.The script attempts to make the story of AI galactic domination relatable by focusing on Atlas's (Lopez) personal history with betrayal. Unfortunately it throws the entire weight of impending genocide out of orbit. It makes the trials of the protagonist feel small; and Lopez, not looking dirty enough or scarred enough, hits every mark we see coming from a mile away.Mark Strong, Simu Liu and other supporting cast members are saddled with similar story, plot and dialogue problems.What we get is another big splashy Netflix film that will be forgotten in a hurry; to be half-watched while doing chores or sitting on a plane.Bummer."
"7","A Pulpy, fun Sci Fi yarn from San Andreas director with a committed performance from Jennifer Lopez.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9807404/?ref_=tt_urv","ubikcorp","25 May 2024","I have no idea why some reviewers are panning Jennifer Lopez' acting. Her emoting and physical acting, reacting to the intricate cgi environments and an AI sidekick named Smith (nod to The Matrix) is nothing short of astounding. For a Netflix original.film, this is a lean, action packed, often funny and tongue in cheek throwback that will make you feel you've been reading a late 5O's pulp magazine. It revolves around an AI expert sent into space in a last ditch mission to stop a rogue AI from launching an apocalyptic attack against human kind (his idea of saving humanity from themselves). In the.end, a story about redemption and overcoming prejudice, Not bad at all."
"7","Peace To The Fallen...","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9818591/?ref_=tt_urv","cahidi","31 May 2024","I just don't get what made a lot of people kept on hating J-Lo. Saying that she can't act, can't sing, bad hair, bad attitude, etc. And it affected their way of rating this movie. Their rating became subjective, not objective. I mean, I do know that she often acts like a diva on set. But as a reviewer of this movie, I'm gonna be objective. Unlike those morons with clouded judgment. Talking about her acting, it's on point. She really breathe the life into Atlas Shepherd. This movie is a combination of sci-fi and action movie. But it seemed to lean more on the action side. Personally I don't mind at all. Cause I enjoy both genre equally. The story is pretty straightforward and there is no major plot twist. And I think anyone can guess the twist at the end of the movie. It's pretty obvious. But still, it's a great movie, no matter what J-Lo's haters said. You'd be an idiot to miss this one. Especially if you're a fan of action or sci-fi movies."
"4","Unfortunately not a good movie...again.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9806076/?ref_=tt_urv","johnnychicago-75285","24 May 2024","That was one of the movies where I'm glad I wasn't sitting in the theater. Otherwise I would have mourned my money and left the theater before the last half hour, or maybe even earlier. I was able to fast-forward and wasn't surprised in the end because the ending was predictable, just like the whole movie. Doesn't anyone bother to write a coherent story anymore? A few action sequences and some CGI were still reasonably well done, but they don't make up for the bad story, the lousy dialog and the plot holes. In the beginning I still had hope that the movie would be reasonably good, but as the story progressed this hope also faded. A movie to forget...unfortunately. I give it 4 stars because the beginning was still reasonably entertaining."
"8","Underratted","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9809116/?ref_=tt_urv","fountainofjuice","26 May 2024","I'm not sure why there are so many sub-par ratings. This movie is a solid action adventure sci-fi with heart. Jennifer Lopez delivers a great performance that is underappreciated. There's so much available at the click of a button for the spoiled entertainment junkies these days that perhaps their expectations have gone rotten. I liked this movie, and it doesn't really matter if the basic story is one that has been told before. The execution was done well and the acting was solid. The special effects are also impressive, such that if this movie were released 20 or 30 years ago it might have been hailed as a masterpiece."
"7","A Sci-Fi Spectacle with Heart and Vision","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9808280/?ref_=tt_urv","arsalanweb","25 May 2024","Atlas is a cinematic venture that aims high and largely succeeds in delivering a visually striking and emotionally resonant experience. Set in a dystopian future where humanity's survival hinges on a delicate balance between technology and nature, the film crafts a world that is both hauntingly beautiful and starkly terrifying.The movie's strongest asset is its visual storytelling. The art direction and cinematography work in tandem to create a universe that feels lived-in and plausible, yet alien enough to capture the imagination. The landscapes, both urban and rural, are meticulously detailed, and the use of color and light effectively conveys the contrasting themes of hope and despair.The narrative, while occasionally dipping into familiar sci-fi tropes, is engaging and thought-provoking. It explores themes of identity, sacrifice, and the human condition with a deft touch, avoiding heavy-handedness. The plot twists are well-executed, keeping the audience on their toes without resorting to cheap gimmicks.Performances are uniformly strong, with each actor bringing depth and nuance to their roles. The protagonist's journey is compelling, marked by moments of vulnerability and strength that feel genuine and earned. The supporting cast also delivers, providing memorable performances that enhance the film's emotional core.The film's score deserves special mention. It underscores the action and drama without overpowering it, complementing the visual elements perfectly. The music enhances the narrative, adding layers of emotion and tension that elevate key scenes.However, Atlas is not without its flaws. The pacing, particularly in the second act, can feel uneven, with certain sequences dragging longer than necessary. Additionally, some of the secondary characters, while well-acted, lack the development needed to make their arcs fully satisfying.Despite these minor issues, Atlas stands out as a noteworthy entry in the science fiction genre. It balances spectacle with substance, offering a film that is as intellectually stimulating as it is visually captivating. For fans of thought-provoking cinema, Atlas is a journey worth taking."
"3","barely watchable","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9806370/?ref_=tt_urv","ferguson-6","24 May 2024","Greetings again from the darkness. My goal is to give every movie a fair shake, and to seek out the best elements even when a film disappoints. I don't recall a time when this goal has been more difficult to achieve than after watching this latest from director Brad Peyton (San Andreas, 2015) and co-writers Leo Sardarian (""StartUp""), Aron Eli Coleite (""Locke & Key"").Jennifer Lopez stars as Atlas Shepherd, a brilliant government analyst and expert on AI, especially on Harlan (Simu Liu, BARBIE), ominously deemed the world's first AI terrorist. We know Atlas is smart because she has a chess winning streak against the computer and she wears black frame eyeglasses. After an opening which features Earth in peril, we flash forward 28 years, where it's evolved into ""good AI"" versus ""evil AI"". Don't worry, Atlas is on the side of good, despite her constantly frazzled state (with perfect hair) and the personal (emotional) baggage she carries with her.After years of searching, Atlas discovers the location for Harlan, and General Boothe (Mark Strong, character actor extraordinaire) forms a team led by Colonel Elias Banks (Sterling K Brown, AMERICAN FICTION, 2023) to capture Harlan so his CPU can be studied. Of course, the mission doesn't go as planned and by the end, I was wondering which racked up the most points: explosions or Ms. Lopez's cringy acting moments. Terrible punchlines regarding a running coffee gag placed third in the competition. Since I admittedly search for positives in every movie, let's go with Simu Liu's unusual blue-eyed effect, the tight pants on Agent Atlas, and giant robotics that look like the one that went rogue in ROBOCOP (37 years ago). Apologies, but that's the best I can do for this one, other than to say we have an early Razzie frontrunner.On Netflix beginning May 24, 2024."
"7","Entertaining.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9823240/?ref_=tt_urv","denelou","2 June 2024","I want the fictional movies I watch to be entertaining. I don't want to fall asleep while watching. This movie was, and I didn't . It wasn't extraordinary, and no Oscar hopefuls, but I like JLo, I could follow the storyline, and I found it believable...I liked it.When I watch a movie I want the following...
To learn something that interests me,
To escape the world around me by immersing my mind,
To share an enjoyable moment with a loved one...'
...for example, This movie fulfilled one or more of my criteria.Would I watch this again? Probably not. Movies I really like I usually watch more than once. Movies I adore, for sure. But for the amount of time it took to watch this movie, it entertained."
"7","Come on... This isn't a bad movie!!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9818665/?ref_=tt_urv","rhayesjr","31 May 2024","Is this a movie perfect... by no means!Does it have plot holes the size of the Andromeda galaxy... for sure!Is the dialog sometimes a little corny... you betcha!But, if you can put that asside... you'll be entertained!!Descent acting, great action, cool CG and well polished set design!Jennifer Lopez is very underrated, she is excellent in this and her performance here, basically makes this movie good...The biggest problem with this movie is that Simu Liu is serverely under utilized. They could of easily added 15-20 minutes of backstory instead of just skimming over with a few flashbacks. It would of made the story deeper and help us relate more to the characters.Cool sci-fi ride!!"
"6","I thought it was a decent Sci-fi movie","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9826337/?ref_=tt_urv","bbickley13-921-58664","4 June 2024",". I don't know if this is an issue with Netflix or movies in general but I will blame Netflix. The fact that we are streaming this movie may mean the budget was not up to Pahor for a theatrical release, which means they did not have the money for as many epic battles as I would hope for. This could have been done on purpose for the sake of the story, but it does place a lot of action packed sci-fi in a movie that's not to be that.The action was on point in this movie. Shout on for Sterling K. Brown who nailed his role and is possibly the best reason to see this film.Overall, I thought it was a good sci-fi story and the story is told well."
"1","Another Generic Netflix Action Blockbuster!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9806670/?ref_=tt_urv","jared-25331","24 May 2024","For the past couple of years, Netflix has been released a lot of Action Blockbusters onto their streaming service. There have been some great ones like the two Extraction Movies with Chris Hemsworth, but there's also been a number of them that have been bombing critically with critics and audiences. It's gotten to the point where no one cares or even talks about them and Atlas (2024) is yet another prime example of that trend. With all that being said, it's time to talk about the movie.Positives for Atlas (2024):
If you enjoy these Netflix Action Blockbusters, then you'll definitely enjoy this one. That's it for the positives.Negatives for Atlas (2024):
First of all, the plot of this movie is one we've seen done a billion times before and done better in other movies. Also, you have Jennifer Lopez as the main protagonist of the movie and all I have to say is Why? I don't have anything against J-Lo, but she just doesn't fit this role, you could literally replace her with any other actor or actress and you would still have the same movie. The storyline between her character and this A. I. is as boring and generic as you would expect. Also, the movie completely wastes Sterling K. Brown, Simu Liu and Mark Strong. There's a lot more I could talk about, but it's the same old stuff in other Netflix Action Blockbusters.Overall, this is a movie that everyone will forget about and they'll be moving on with their lives. Netflix, could you please put some more effort into your Action Blockbusters I would greatly appreciate it."
"9","Enjoyable - sci-fi cgi flick with titan fall elements","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9807433/?ref_=tt_urv","mikahofmann","25 May 2024","I have to say I don't get the hate. It is a nice sci-fi cgi. The titanfall comparison is really enjoyable.Pros:The movie got a lot of fun and good cgi
The story is enjoyable
Acting is kinda good (shocking for me, thought it would be worse)
Comedy and action is nicely divided
The References to the gaming world are really goodCons:Sometimes cgi is not fully good, like you see in one part of the frame a slight downside of the cgi or in a movement some small mistakes
Story is relatively predictable (though probably only if you watch a lot of those movies or play similar games)A last note:
I do think it is a great idea do combine game worlds and movies. There is so much potential out there. Yes, these are not fully original pieces, but they are a heck of a lot better than brainless refurbished movies. Also with this movie you can really see what cgi can be if you give the team their budget and time to finish what they want to show us.Conclusion:
It's a 9/10 for me.You should give it a try."
"6","Decent sci-fi/fantasy, but could easily be much much better!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9808472/?ref_=tt_urv","vitalymakievsky","25 May 2024","The movie starts out great. We have a cop who is frustrated with her life, she's an emotional mess, heavily addicted to coffee and falls a sleep on the couch regularly, living the bachelor's lifestyle. So your typical 80's and early 90s cop movie start but with a PG-13 rating.Our protagonist Atlas, is also a bit rash, hyper intelligent, she doesn't like to play by the rules, mistrusting, and is a bit to heavy handed. I really liked that this Hollywood trope and I've never seen this type character given to a female lead. Made the old trope fresher.I hate to say this, but this movie is a missed opportunity for a great sci-fi move. But it is sort of broken into two peaces. On one side it's a real deal sci-fi, and on the other it's a pure action movie. And a lot of this action could have been cut out to explore more sciency stuffs.For you who like a character driven plot, you might like this movie. Our protagonist is forced to go on an extremely dangerous mission, and in order to save her life and accomplish her life's mission, she has to learn to trust an AI robot, and grow as a person.There are some serious issues in this movie, on how technology works, based on the information the audience is given, and a few highly derivative scenes designed to keep the character narrative progressing forward...but it is a movie, and not a book.I looked at a few reviews, and I was very surprised at the hate on Jenifer Lopez. I have never been into pop culture and didn't realize who the lead was until I looked at the IMBD actors list. I personally think she did a great job, looked great with the new hairstyle, and playing a different character. She is very likable. So, my point is I have no idea why she is despised by so many reviewers...? Perhaps, she made some insensitive comments in the pop literature? I just don't know.Overall, this could have been a very serious sci-fi movie, but the direction opted for an action movie instead. So grab a beers or a wine bottle, put you thinking cap do the side, and enjoy the pretty ride."
"3","It's bad!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9806510/?ref_=tt_urv","christineballone","24 May 2024","Big sci-fi fan here who tolerates even bad films just for the SFX but unfortunately this has such bad acting by Jennifer Lopez that I have to force myself to continue even under stress lol! The crying scenes are so fake and the whole movie centres around her so also bearable in the beginning the more it goes on it becomes unwatchable. Sorry Jennifer but I guess you don't really care, you're super rich and want to immortalize yourself as much as possible. The SFX are nice showing another planet far far away that she reaches almost instantly after lifting of earth. The villain is well known through the MU and I like him but he can't save the film.There are a lot of movies coming out showing hate for AI and I don't get it. The beneficial applications outweigh the negative aspect and I think a scenario where AI is killing humans on their own is far fetched! I did like Jennifer Lopez in "" the cell"" so she is not a complete waste acting wise, just give her some good script and she would be fine! Recommend watching only for having the Poto form your own opinion!"
"7","Great for what it is","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9811317/?ref_=tt_urv","martinsayon","27 May 2024","It's not an amazing script, a lot of it feels completely illogical, but if you watch the film as a fun action/adventure into distant worlds then you'll have an enjoyable ride. I loved the alien world building. The bond with the robot shell and analyst (JLo) was very sweet. If you like interstellar travel films for the sake of basking in new visual landscapes, definitely worth checking out. I also enjoyed the AI doomsday scenario. Don't watch this as an arthouse auteur film, just sit back relax & enjoy the ride. Critics are so sheep herd mentality these days. Sigh. I'm a filmmaker myself and love it when I enjoy a film that all the critics love to hate."
"1","The bad acting in this is beyond amateur.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9805978/?ref_=tt_urv","ejvans","24 May 2024","Seemed like a good story, but Lopex's horrendous acting was a complete turn off. Movie didn't hold my attention.And the main character has to be one of the worst ever. I literally found myself skipping forward through Jlo dialogue spots.The CGI often times shows. Lopez's acting is abysmal at best and truly makes the movie unenjoyable. The movie would have been better if the AI were the main characters. Lopez is also showing her age with very weird body shape in the skintight out fits they chose for her.CGI scenes area well done but the things happen to the are absurd and breaks immersion. Overall I rate this show a 1 star because if faile don so many levels.Also, the fact the Jlo says over and over again she's not a combat person she's better than trained special op entire squad. More extreme plot holes."
"5","Cringeworthy with good CGI","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9806293/?ref_=tt_urv","satin-48250","24 May 2024","It's a miss. And Jennifer Lopez is not the main culprit.The story is a bad toned-down rehash of Infinity war. Thanos was much more interesting there than that new Malthusian nemesis here. And the whole arc is boringly predictable.The dialogues are often cheesy and almost always cringeworthy.Jennifer Lopez has been better. She's trying to do her job professionally but her performance is soulless.The CGI are good.I haven't checked the budget but it's obviously way too much.It's ok to watch on a rainy day.As a side thought, Netflix looks really lost. They are wasting indecent amounts of money in mediocre movies and series and stop their more creative productions before their end. Headless chickens at the helm. That looks a lot like finance people have too much of a say. But I guess that won't change as long as their subscription tricks get them so much cash."
"8","Ignore the critics","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9810113/?ref_=tt_urv","craigswift-23075","26 May 2024","Not sure why this got such terrible reviews. Yeah there is lots of CGI in the film. Yes it does nick from other from other sci fi films.However this is a good film. Jennifer is very good in this film and the AI Smith is great. The relationship between them both is funny and hilarious in some parts.The story isn't too bad and the plot goes along rather well with lots happening to keep you interested. This isn't a bad film and in fact I really enjoyed it.Would I watch it again, which is a good basis of if it's a good film or not. Yes I would. On repeat viewing you get to see things that you missed first time around.Ignore what the critics say. When I watch the films they rave about, I'm bored in the first 10 mins and tend to switch off. If you just want to enjoy a film and be entertained then give this film a go."
"6","Far from bad","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9806577/?ref_=tt_urv","thatpugs","24 May 2024","Atlas has all the makings of a fantastic video game but unfortunately as a film just plays out as a complication of cut scenes without any real substance.Treat it like you are watching one of those video game all cut scenes ""movies"" you can find on youtube. You will get any and all essential information to understand the plot, but the real enjoyment from the story is missing as you feel like you should be at the helm and not just watching.In that regard nearly all the charachters other than our main protagonist have real life and are a joy to see even in their relatively short appearances with the titular charachter doing little for the story in her own right."
"1","Disappointing Film: JLO's Character Falls Flat with Constant Tears and Poor Acting","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9806423/?ref_=tt_urv","jagoreet","24 May 2024","One of the worst movies I've ever watched. JLO's character is written in a particularly poor manner, lacking depth and consistency. From the very start of the movie until the end, her character does nothing but cry. It's just crying, crying, and more crying. It becomes frustrating to watch as it feels like there's no development or growth in her role. Moreover, JLO's acting in this film is subpar, far from her usual performances. She seems disconnected and unable to convey any genuine emotion beyond the endless tears. Overall, this movie is a huge letdown, and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone."
"7","Came for some escapism and this delivered!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9809556/?ref_=tt_urv","fat_gibberish_monkey","26 May 2024","Now let's first set some realistic expectations. A Netflix movie with Jennifer Lopez (also producing) in a large robot-suit for two-thirds of the movie, and directed by the same guy who made Journey 2 and Cats & Dogs 2. Red flags all round, right?Well count me surprised, because this was actually a perfectly watchable and undemanding action sci-fi, which despite borrowing from much better films of the genre, still managed to provide a decent 2 hours worth of escapism.Being a huge fan of sci-fi, and being particularly fond of some of the films this one borrowed / ripped-off, including Edge of Tomorrow, and Aliens, this still delivered with some very entertaining robot-suit mayhem. Particularly impressive, was the sky-crash scene reminiscent of the beach landing from the aforementioned Edge of Tomorrow, certainly helped by the $100m worth of CG spent on the movie, and a very fun Atmos mix to boot.My only real disappointment coming away was that they had two great actors with Mark Strong and Sterling K. Brown, and yet they were criminally underused, especially the former. Still, the film remained an entertaining little romp, so try not to be too put off by the dismal reviews, and give it a try!"
"7","Scratched my Titanfall Itch","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9812708/?ref_=tt_urv","savastosic","28 May 2024","""Atlas"" is a film that, while not deep in plot or character development, is undeniably a fun and exhilarating watch. The storyline may be ankle-deep, but it manages to keep you entertained throughout with its fast pace and engaging action sequences.One of the standout aspects of ""Atlas"" is its incredible CGI. The visual effects are top-notch, making every scene a visual treat. Whether it's the sprawling landscapes or the intense battle scenes, the CGI brings the world of ""Atlas"" to life in a way that is both stunning and immersive.The bond between the main character and the robot is expertly portrayed. This relationship adds a layer of emotional depth to the movie that, while not overly complex, is heartfelt and engaging. The dynamic between the two is reminiscent of the connection seen in the Titanfall game series, making it a hit for fans of the franchise.Overall, ""Atlas"" may not be the most profound movie in terms of plot or character development, but it excels in delivering a visually spectacular and thoroughly enjoyable experience. If you're a fan of action-packed films or the Titanfall games, ""Atlas"" is definitely worth a watch."
"7","Great writing and very good cgi","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9806716/?ref_=tt_urv","Erik_Stone","24 May 2024","It's a fun movie, with a good plot. The writing was surprisingly good and has some great moments of comedy as well as classic drama. I enjoyed it.Mostly excellent casting, except for Jennifer Lopez. She really had a difficult time getting into her character at the beginning. Jennifer could have done this role when she was younger, but she can't really pull off ""the dumb blonde"" at her age, now, even though the character called for an older woman. Jennifer just isn't a character actress, and this film could have been a 10, if she was.Producers seem to like starring in the own movies nowadays.SciFi folks will like it. It's solidly better than most of the SciFi being made today.Even for the discriminating SciFi junkie, you won't rate this less than a 4, and you might even rate it an 8."

How we develop relationships and what these mean. Machine, Humans, AI.. where do we stand in this?Can be cheesy, can be simple and stereotyped, but it is still about who we are, what we do, create and perpetuate, the courage to change, to learn, to face our own fears with awareness and authenticity.The future is coming fast, and we have to learn and become better at how we live together and with each other on our planet.So, we shall see how this unfolds, will we destroy ourselves as we already started, or will we have the guts to change and grow..?With AI.."

It's a fun romp of a science fiction flick but it's super painful watch at the end of the day. Jennifer Lopez is a truly brutal actress! Nails on a chalkboard. The sound of bad brake pads and brake rotors on a neglected car. The sound of a jackhammer. All these things are better than enduring Jennifer Lopez and her terrible acting skills. I pity anyone who gives this ""movie"" a rating of two or more stars. Her husband Ben Affleck is a far superior actor. Don't believe me? Think I am crazy for taking the time out of my day to write such a horrid review? Watch this ""movie"" and see for yourself. The movie critics are 100% accurate here. She phoned it in."
"6","More of a Sci-fi psychological drama","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9808994/?ref_=tt_urv","wingzero203","26 May 2024","Depending on your interest level of sci-fi and drama, you may or may not enjoy this movie. Of course, there's no shortage of impressive and elegant CGI considering the genre but this movie takes a different plot path, relative to the now-predictable ""AI-becomes-sentient-and-quickly-obliterates-mankind"" plots like you see in the Terminator and Matrix franchises. They take a different direction of how AI becomes sentient and its actions condemning mankind in this movie.Some have said Jennifer Lopez was incorrectly cast but she's no stranger to drama roles considering she's played similar psychologically-conflicted characters like in The Cell (2000), Enough (2002), and The Mother (2023).I wouldn't put this movie on the same sci-fi caliber as Aliens, Terminator or Blade Runner but at the very least, this movie is worth a watch if you're bored on a Tuesday night."

The KI theme was a joke because it was nothing like the real development KI is taking. Just a bad idea of a bad writer who has no idea what KI is. But what do you expect from ""Hollywood"" this days!? The story was very very simple and there are scenes you want to give the main character a kick to the b..t because the decisions she was taking are so bad. And then all the MacGuffins... everytime you need some object or element in the story... it magically appears. Just like in real life... hahahah ... this whole thing is so stupid I hope people will rate it with 1 star, so Netflix is starting to watch on quality in the future. I do not need brain dead stuff like Rebel Moon or Atlas. Some more and I am cancelling my description."

Please please please."
"1","When will they teach Jennifer to act?","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9811688/?ref_=tt_urv","scottdempsey-33857","27 May 2024","The only emotions in the whole film for Jennifer was to scream, swear, and throw tantrums. The character had no depth. The plot was predictable with the spoiled Atlas getting what she wanted in the end. The supporting cast was severely hampered by Jennifer's need to be the center of every single part of the film. Please do NOT make a sequel to this film. Spend the money on acting lessons for Jennifer and on script writing lessons for writers. Simply do something original. Like Atlas and Smith, do something nobody expects. Also add depth to the characters and involve more diversity in the cast."
"7","Not as awful...","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9815190/?ref_=tt_urv","shazammatlast","29 May 2024","This flick is not as awful as some reviews attest. Actually, some parts are just what it is supposed to deliver-entertainment. The hardest part for me suspend disbelief over is JLo as a 39-40 year old. JLo is a 54, 55 in two months as of this review. Lots of brushing up of the filtering and other cinematic tricks can't keep me from thinking, ""Gads. She is 54."" Her character also cries too much. There's no crying in SciFi space! The ARC is too familiar though. Did filmmakers go to a half of movie set fire sale for those things? Because I am pretty sure I've seen facsimiles in Alien, Avatar, Edge of Tomorrow, and Pacific Rim, to name a few. Other than that, I enjoyed some of the visual sci fi details-the trippy eye effects, some of the weaponry come to mind first, but there are others. Atlas won't win awards or rise to icon status, but for a night's fun, it's fine. Just stop dry crying, Lopez. It's annoying."
"6","Expected it to be worse. Not a bad Sci-Fi action movie.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9811647/?ref_=tt_urv","crazydwarfer","27 May 2024","I was expecting a worse movie overall. The storyline was not great, but not terrible. The acting overall was ok. Jennifer Lopez on the other hand, was acting as always. She was overacting, and overall seemed not too good of a choice for this role. I think Emily Blunt or Milla Jovovich would have elevated the movie to 7 at least momentarily. If they would have added another 10-20 millions to the budget for special effects, and improved the story a bit, to make it just a tad more nuanced and complicated it would be a hit. 8 -100%. I liked the action, the flora somewhere out there in the second part of the movie. Not a bad movie at all."
"1","Awful in every way","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9810175/?ref_=tt_urv","bdjvqmdwv","26 May 2024","Poorly acted, poorly directed, awful story. Dialogue was trite, overly simplistic and predictable and the cinematography was blas√© and took away from any potential interest in the action and dialogue (although there was hardly anything interesting in the action or dialogue, frankly). This movie was just appallingly bad. Also, this was probably the creepiest thing I've seen since Elon Musk tried to put chips in those monkeys heads and tortured them. The subtitle on the posters should've been."" AI is great! No, really! Just let us into your heads and we'll show you"".I was amazed to see the actors that signed up for this. They should get the fees refunded from their agents, as this will probably be a blow to their careers.In summary, WTF!?!?!?"
"7","Pretty good despite obvious flaws !!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9806227/?ref_=tt_urv","ashish-cooltech","24 May 2024","Well firstly I'll admit this is not a ground breaking sci fi movie like Arrival or AI. The basic theme of robot rising is not new in itself and there are some very basic flaws in the story. For example why would an AI that is smart enough to re-program its code and create an uprising limit itself to one physical form which could cause its demise ? Its a typical action movie that ditches logic at convenience. However that doesn't mean it is a pathetic movie by any stretch. The Neuralink connection is very beautifully depicted, action sequences are good and JLO acting is fairly decent. Not sure why people are focusing so much on the negatives. I enjoyed it as a cool sci fi action flick without getting too serious on some shortcomings."
"1","An interesting story ruined by horrible acting.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9808812/?ref_=tt_urv","pridgeondesigngroup","25 May 2024","This film is almost like a one man play so it requires an actor with great skill to keep it engaging. I've never thought much about J Lo's acting, but her bad performance in this film really stands out. Not in a good way. I don't recall ever seeing an actor playing a soldier whose character needed so much makeup and hair maintenance. I've got to save the Earth from destruction, but let me first spend an hour doing my makeup and hair. The real issue is that she just doesn't find the character. There are scenes where she is cracking jokes and trying to be funny, and then other scenes where she is supposed to be in tremendous pain and experiencing intense fear and sorrow, but she plays it all the same. She has the same expression on her face, and she always looks more like an aging model than a soldier saving the world. A role like this would have been great for Aubrey Plaza, or anyone else that tried a little harder to create a believable character and was less concerned about how they look in the mirror."

It was pretty good better than Rebel Moon on Netflix I'll say that. And I had high hopes for Rebel Moon. Hopefully it will have a sequel and be better than rebel moons sequel. The only thing I didn't like and I know it was supposed to be funny so it wasn't like it was a big deal someone Or some thing brings up pronouns I don't Want to give anything away and it made me raise my eyebrow. Luckily, that was the only thing they added in that nature all in all pretty good movie."

OK.It all felt like it should have been a computer game first. Choose your weapons, find the target, get more supplies, get to the end and fight the boss. Yawn.Jennifer Lopez doing another boss babe thing only proves that she cannot act. Mark Strong phones it in.I just found it really boring and you should avoid it at all costs. I dread to think what it cost to make. Best avoided."
"7","Surprisingly entertaining...","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9810198/?ref_=tt_urv","paul_haakonsen","26 May 2024","Well, truth be told, then I wasn't exactly harboring a whole lot of expectations to this 2024 action sci-fi movie titled ""Atlas"" as it was a sci-fi movie about AI and it was starring Jennifer Lopez. So yeah, that wasn't exactly sounding like a winning combination.But as always, I let a movie that I haven't already seen, the benefit from the doubt, and thus I opted to sit down and watch the movie as it was readily available on Netflix. And color me impressed.This movie was really entertaining. I enjoyed the storyline, though the blatant 'AI is a bad thing' doctrine that permeated the entire movie, was something that you can get to look past, and just enjoy the movie for the popcorn sci-fi action flick that it is. Writers Leo Sardarian and Aron Eli Coleite managed to put together an enjoyable and entertaining sci-fi action script, you just have to casually brush off the bombardment of 'AI is bad'.Sure, the script and storyline was not spot on perfect. There were plot holes and things that didn't make much of any sense. In a world where they had lasers, spaceships, interstellar travel, armored robotic suits, etc., it just made little sense why handheld firearms still would fire old fashioned bullets. Or just how Harlan Shepherd had managed to harvest the materials for building a city fortress over the past 28 years on a remote planet far away from everything. But hey, just shrug it off as you much on the popcorn, and don't fuzz too much about it.Even Jennifer Lopez impressed me with this movie. I actually think that this movie was the best movie of hers that I have sat through. It was nice to see her branch out and away from the generic, sappy and clich√© romantic comedies that she has a tendency of popping up in. I wasn't familiar with Simu Liu, but he put on a good performance in the movie and was a nicely casted actor for the movie. It was also nice to see Mark Strong in the movie, just a shame that he wasn't given a role with more screen time.Visually then I was really impressed with the special effects and CGI in the movie. It looked good and it looked realistic. I liked how much attention to detail they had put into the effects in ""Atlas"", and it really added a lot to the overall impression of the movie.If you enjoy a good old fashioned action sci-fi movie where things doesn't necessarily make scientific sense, then sit down and watch ""Atlas"". Oh, and bring a bucket of popcorn. This is actually a sci-fi movie that I thoroughly enjoyed, and one that I warmly recommend.My rating of ""Atlas"" lands on a well-deserved seven out of ten stars."
"4","Very interesting movie for what the world heading too","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9806153/?ref_=tt_urv","cvzqkjk","24 May 2024","Jennifer Lopez's character is a total eyesore and very childish. She acts like a spoiled kid that complains the whole time and has no sense of being an adult. The pronoun part of the robots was a very not needed path of the film. I wonder how the film directors would of had handled the movie if they just got a proper female character that doesn't throw her toys out of the cot when things are midly inconvenient. Her complete disregard for her own safety when when placed in a life threatening position by declining the neuralinks even at the face of imminent death is completely unrealistic and idiotic."

I thought this movie was awesome! My husband and I enjoyed it! Action packed from beginning to end. It has heart and soul and the ending made me emotional. It also had lots of twists and turns. All the good elements a good sci-fi needs. People are saying they don't like her character but that's the point- she hates AI because of the pain of her past and once you understand that it makes sense. She finds healing at the end is set free from that. I thought Jlos performance was incredible. Her acting was raw and powerful and some of her best acting I've seen in years. Will this movie win awards? No. Will it entertain you? Yes. Enjoy it for what it is!"
"6","Atlas and Smith is the duo I needed","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9815255/?ref_=tt_urv","pclaker","29 May 2024","I heard so many people hated this movie that I needed to see it myself, and after finishing it... it honestly wasn't as bad as people were saying it was. Smith and Atlas' relationship definitely made the movie much more watchable and salvageable almost like the Mandalorian and Droid relationship. The CGI and green screen wasn't the best along with the story, but the dialogue that Atlas and Smith get into throughout the movie had me in my seat waiting for another funny line to come up. If they were to do a second Atlas movie I would not be mad or annoyed about it, but I hope that they can introduce a couple more characters that we can actually care about that also pilot mechs or are soldiers. Overall not as bad a movie that I thought it was going to be."
"1","unbearably bad","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9811435/?ref_=tt_urv","marcoruffatti","27 May 2024","""Atlas,"" starring Jennifer Lopez, is an abysmal disaster from start to finish. Laden with a clich√©-ridden plot and abysmal dialogue, the film fails to deliver any semblance of originality or entertainment. Lopez's performance is wooden, and predictable, hampered by a script that makes her character insufferably clich√©. The pacing is a mess, with a plodding start and a rushed, nonsensical conclusion. Visual effects are mediocre at best, and the action scenes are laughably chaotic. The supporting cast is forgettable, their characters mere plot devices. Overall, ""Atlas"" is a tedious, uninspired waste of time that squanders its potential and star power."

Special effects are really nice eye candy for those that appreciate it. The story was not the most original but still good none the less. The acting was passable and decent. The worst part: the main actress. I can't stand JLo as a person, a singer, dancer and least of all as an actress. Her acting is so forced and fake. Not believable. No Oscar performances here; sorry JLo fan boys.That being said, you decide if you want to see it. Not bad for at least one view."

I read some of the reviews and although I was looking forward to it, the reviews prepared me for it to be just ok. Having just finished watching it I actually really enjoyed the film, if you don't expect it to be what you want it to be it can be entertaining. Some funny titbits, and I liked the relationship between J'lo and the ai Smith. Action was decent but I actually wish the film was longer. A sequel probably won't happen, and, maybe shouldn't, as sequels never really live up to the original, but I would watch it if there ever was. Don't expect too much and just enjoy the film, I did."

Sure, it's not ground-breaking stuff, but it's not supposed to be. Not every film has to be. What it is is a really well-made sci fi action popcorn flick, and a great way to spend a couple of hours.The world-building really stood out. The city itself, plus the housing and work spaces we see, all looked amazing. The CGI overall was excellent. If you really nitpick a few seconds here and there might look a bit like a computer game (the outdoor snow planet scenery was a bit guilty of this). Otherwise I thought it all felt and looked great. The action scenes were also good, I thought they did a decent job emphasising the 'ruthlessness' of AI. And the script in general was perfectly fine. There was one silly reference to another galaxy when any random planet name would have worked better and made more sense. The dialogue between her and Smith made for nice comedic relief.Despite all the criticism I've read here, I thought Jennifer Lopez was pretty good. We already know she's a good actress (Out of Sight, Hustlers) so I don't really get what the outrage is about."
"1","If I hear coffee one more time I swear I'll...","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9810355/?ref_=tt_urv","Chris_Ego","26 May 2024","...tell you why I despise this movie.The writers have some funny ways of presenting this character ATLAS (JLo). The story begins quite mysterious with Atlas being that tough loner who is done with something we don't know yet. Then 2 folks at ICN, an organization that must be something like the UN in the future are talking about the psychological profile of Atlas. It is agreed upon not talking about this topic again. Every 20 minutes we get to see more pieces of the puzzle. Finally it is revealed that Atlas has troubles with trust. Jlo puts all the effort in being emotional, which works most of the time and it is convincing. But after 1 hour of yelling and the occasional nervous breakdowns her character becomes full-on annoying. Since she brings nothing to the table than anger. What worked great in ""Heavy Metal Fakk 2"" is not working in ""Atlas"": a strong female lead doesn't need a psychological analysis or a background story broken into pieces. She just needs to act, to do.It always surprises me when trained marines die like flies and the untrained analyst does all the killing. Why do producers think they will get away with that? This movie is anything but original. The mechs, the killer AI, the armageddon, the unkillable villain. We've had all that before. People who watch ""Atlas"" will always think of ""Alien"", ""Avatar"", ""Terminator"" and games like ""Titanfall"". So why make this movie? Because the last JLo film ""The Mother"" was a huge streaming success? I must say I liked the movie. And JLo has the physique and the wit to play Atlas, but she is backed by good actors and gets stuck in repeating lines of coffee and cursing. The only development her character goes through is the assimilation with computers. Wow. So what is this movie about? It is not a warning, it does not have an interesting plot and it has literally no character to care about.Mentionable performances come from Simu Liu, who plays the AI Terminator great. I would have loved to see him in ""Dark Fate"". Abraham Popoola...are you even a real human? Mark Strong, hello nice to see you alive.Music by Andrew Lockington is making cheesy moments super cheesy. He carries the hero moments well and translates the story into music. Good job. But what a bad movie!Let's talk about the plot holes quickly. I have many questions. Why the wind turbines in the city and not around it? How do necklaces give you oxygen and shield you from radiation? Why does the mech of the main charater sustain 100 times more serious damage than any other combat suit? Why does the AI love its user so much without any reason? How can the rescue team show up just 1 minute after the showdown? Why does the user have to physically run inside the mech to make the robot walk when they are neuro-linked which triggers all the movement and combat?Well maybe you explain all this in ""Atlas 2"", but raise the bar significantly."

It deserves 6.7. I gave it 7 just to upgrade its rating because 5.3 is just too low. Even she isn't too distracting. I've seen far worse actors. So all this focus on her is boring. It's far better than most ""AI destroying the world"" movies. Sometimes it's funny, there are not many cringe lines. I mean, it's an ok movie to watch when you're into an easy evening, wanting to watch something that's not requiring emotional involvement. For example, I find it much, much better than Rebel Moon movies, even acting is better."

But the movie is emotional and well played.the action is from beginning to the end. Somehow it I feel there are parts in the movie is predictable. I think there should be another part. Jennifer Lopez is a good actor and her emotions were very hard at the beginning. Not too much to talk about the movie except I liked the robots . The movie is very good .the story is emotional and well explained. It's not unique but has its own character based on science fiction movies that we don't see lots of them. I really enjoyed the movie."

Really unbelievable, she ruins the film so much.She's such an old depressed wreck who constantly screams and has no idea what to do, even though the damn cool robot keeps telling her what to do. But no, she'd rather die and cause a huge drama... I really can't finish watching the film because it's just another film where you wish everyone would die...
Without Jennifer Lopez the film would get a 10 from me... But with her 2 stars are already too many... :("
"6","Human intelligence and artificial intelligence sync well in this explosive sci-fi action saga","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9805548/?ref_=tt_urv","SAMTHEBESTEST","24 May 2024","Atlas (2024) :
Movie Review -Atlas, starring Jennifer Lopez, brings Brad Peyton back in action. One must realize that Jlo on stage is different, and Jlo on screen is different. The stage one will always be far superior, and the on-screen Jlo may not go well with many cine-viewers. Atlas is Peyton's version of Transformers and Avatar clashing with each other in an AI-driven futuristic universe. The disaster lover Peyton goes dystopian but brings more emotions and explosions alongside his regular mainstream tantrums of entertainment. Jlo fit well in the suit; I don't know how, and I did not even expect it, but it happened, and for our own good. Lopez immerses herself in the character, and despite that ""you are looking old"" taunt, she manages to look fit and somewhat sexy without any skin exposed. In short, Atlas makes a fairly entertaining watch for action-drama lovers who can digest some holy-smokin theories of a futuristic AI world.The film begins with Atlas Shepherd (Jennifer Lopez) waking up in an AI-driven world and speaking to even more superior software than Alexa. She is a brilliant but misanthropic data analyst with a deep distrust of artificial intelligence, which was caused by a painful trauma in her childhood. What's that? We get to know later, of course. Harlan (Simu Liu) is an AI robot who has been planning to wipe out humanity and bring new mankind into this world for years. Colonel Banks (Sterling K. Brown) is off to find him and destroy him, but he needs someone intelligent like Atlas to be with him. Atlas believes that she should be on this mission because she knows Harlan better than anybody else could and that he is smarter than any of them humans. She joins a mission to capture a renegade robot with whom she shares a mysterious past. When plans go awry, her only hope of saving the future of humanity from AI is to trust it and go in for 100% syncing.In exactly two hours, Atlas hardly has any larger-than-life theory in its storyline. It's simple, and in this case, that helps. You can't get too complicated with AI theories because that's totally fictional and might cause the audience to lose human connect. Atlas keeps things pacy and engaging, so you don't really want to move from your sofa. As expected, it gets a bit dramatic and cliched by the end, but not to the level of a headache. Shepherd's physical and emotional connect with Smith, the AI suit, is typically sorted, but you feel their bonding. The friendship is there, and we, as humans, can't hate that thing ever. It may remind you of Stephen Lang's colonel Miles from Cameron's ""Avatar"" (2009), with the only difference being that he was an antagonist, and here Shepherd is in the positive role.Jennifer Lopez has surprised me with her acting skills here. I guess many of you will agree with me when I say that her discography is much better than her filmography. Her singing and dancing skills are better than her acting skills. Despite being a firm believer in these two things, I liked her as an actor in this film. Now you can imagine the impact she has created here. Those emotionally tormenting scenes were too good. The neural sync with Smith was definitely amazing. I didn't fall for her hot figure and face, but her personality and tech-savvy conversations really won me over. Simu Liu made a perfect villain, but his screen space was too low. It happens with many non-human villains; they are deadly, but they can't be like humans. Sterling K. Brown played a fine colonel, and so did Mark Strong. Abraham Popoola's Casca Robo was fairly good, and Lana Parrilla did an excellent job in her small role.Talking about action, Atlas isn't an upgraded flick or too modern about it, but it definitely has those traditional set pieces that you enjoy on any off day. I think they could have made the futuristic war weapons more dangerous and lethal rather than just using an ION bomb and fire shots. Simu's use of the Rings MCU looked far more futuristic than the sword he used here as a robot in the future world. Also, the film lacks some heavy punchlines. Maybe because there was no male protagonist. The macho stuff was missing; even though Smith added something of its own, it wasn't enough. The explosions were entertaining and pleasant. The production design and background score were okay. Atlas' camerawork doesn't offer anything new since it is set in an AI world; all we have are those same close-ups during fight sequences and top views of forests, robots, and fighter planes. Those who know Brad Peyton for Journey 2, San Andreas, and Rampage will get what they are looking for here. He just changed the world, not his ideas. He may be stuck to them, but that's fairly enough to pass your two hours on Netflix.RATING - 6/10*"
"7","Entertaining sci fi AI story","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9817568/?ref_=tt_urv","ClassAShares","31 May 2024","This movie was quite enjoyable. It follows the story of a woman Atlas which unfolds and sets up the premise for the movie that she must accomplish a mission.The graphics and acting were very good for a title that isn't from a longtime majorly known series. Jennifer was very good in setting up her character and evolving through the movie to setup the final scene. I did not perceive any character discrepancies or major flaws that detracted from the story.I went into the movie with no knowledge of the setup or premise, no knowledge of who the main actors/actresses even were and was pleasantly surprised with the story and ending.Enjoyable sci-fi which lets the imagination fly along with the story to race and figure out what is happening and how everything will end. Though somewhat predictable it was well executed and kept me on the edge of my seat till the end.What held the movie back was the reuse of elements that were pioneered recent sci fi movies. So it was a new story with many parts that were already done well and most sci-fi lovers will likely pick up on these similar themes. So although it was a new spin and take on AI, the AI antagonist just replaces 'aliens' in a bunch of older movies and then mashed their story elements together. So during the movie I kept thinking fondly of other movies.This reuse of elements is likely where critics got really harsh on the movie inspiring more criticism from people. In reality it's no different than many movies that have come before it taking a well received storylines or sequences and creating something different and new but also not pioneering the movie experience despite having a fresh platform for humans vs AI.For me it's a fun watch as a scifi enthusiast and I have no issues saying that I enjoyed the movie plot, scenes, graphics and ending despite not being a fan of any specific actors."

She stank at this role , The crying , whining and just bad Over Acting was So painful to watch , A better choice of Actor would have been so a great Joy. And please Don't make a Sequel with her in it , This was bad enough, Why was she Left on Screen for so long Alone ........ Her Character had possibilities, But Poor acting and poor Directing couldn't and didn't help at All. Some will like this movie and some will like watching paint dry also. This is just my Opinion and I gave it two stars , Watch at your Own Risk ..... Ten thumbs. Down."

It is mindless fun and the less you think about it the better. There's a story, but who cares: big BOOMS!J-LO acts decently, although her character complains and cries too much instead of becoming a badass, which would have made more sense for what the movie offers. The other actors also do a decent job with likeable characters. Harlan's actor is creepy as an AI baddie.Don't expect Aliens or even Total Recall quality, but some of their knockoffs.What you read now is just to fill the minimum characters for a review to be approved. There's no more to be said about it, since the story about AI is as predictable as it can be. Just enjoy its nonsensical fun on a big TV with sound amped up to make your neighbors complain!

"1","Had to stop watching","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9806572/?ref_=tt_urv","sixmagpiesleather","24 May 2024","Embarrassing for everyone involved. Hollywood is so far lost up it's own behind it has completely lost touch with what an audience would connect with.Terrible acting by Lopez. Ruins every scene she's in. Everyone else that is a good actor just come off as cringey and taking themselves too seriously because the film is so bad.CGI wasn't bad, the plot is so weak though and the film is unwatchable as it's miscast completely with Lopez.With different casting it could have been an easy to watch, quick to forget sci-fi rompNot sure who they're aiming the film at. It makes no sense to make this film the way they have. It must ge some kind of tax write off thing that us plebs don't understand."
"7","Really Enjoyed it, J-Lo rocks it","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9807609/?ref_=tt_urv","Jim_Screechy","25 May 2024","I had not expectations about this having barely heard much and never seen the trailers, but as an AI fan immediately set an evening aside to watch on Neflix.I really like this one; it does what it says on the tin and doesn't really attempt to be anything other than what it promises without apology. Its a decent story, that has been thrashed out fairly well, and given what it offer I think it more than delivers.To be fair its a well worn theme spun with new thread, but what isn't these days. Its all in the delivery and this delivers without question. Lots of action, explosions, a bit of intrigue and a half decent tale woven into an action movie about the looming pitfalls for humanity given our arrogance regarding technological development... sound familiar? As yet another of the 'humanity doomed due to AI' renditions, it ranks amoung the top tier in being engaing and entertaining.Its a better script than I'd expect for somethig this hackneyed, with very good direction and great CGI. The cast is very capable and J-Lo is on point in the leading role.J-Lo plays an an agitated, highly driven woman with an axe to grind against the institutions handling AI being somewhat of an SME in the field whose mother was instrumental in Ai research and neural interface. That... and later come combat soldier. She certainly delivers. She gives an excellently well developed performance of a character driven account of the person she's representing, and for the most part this is not a well liked character at all. Too many novice reviewers misinterpret characters they con't like as bad actors, which is obviously misconceived, but also misleading and somewhat disengenuous.Anyway I'm not going to pic this one to bits save that its worth watching. I think, the average veiwer with find it entertaining but sci-fi enthusiasts will like it considerably more. I've just watched Gozilla x Kong, and like that too, but this is better... though not as good as Gozilla-1.0 (thats Godzilla one point zero, and not Gozilla minus one as the Western world seems to have interpreted the title)"
"5","A CGI turmoil.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9806278/?ref_=tt_urv","fLick-IX","24 May 2024","Reading science fiction literature is preferable to excessive VFX visuals. Hollywood has a plethora of artificial intelligence films. Any two of these could provide the movie's plot. That's precisely what took place in this instance. This movie is entirely computer-generated imagery, and sixty percent of it is not realistic, particularly the space and asteroidal scenes. Of course, there are mechanical noises in space. Atlas lacks a compelling plot and an idealised direction. In case the film had any message, it did it to the fullest extent possible. The performers made an effort to demonstrate their acting prowess in poignant moments, but it was largely pointless and uninspiring."
"7","Better than expected","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9807162/?ref_=tt_urv","light-rock","25 May 2024","I gave it a decent rating by comparison to everything else currently available in terms of new content, and about one half to one star higher to counteract what I see as some overly negative reviews.The quality of the production is good, the story is good even if we may have seen the basic idea a few times, there are enough new closer to home little things going on to make it a bit fresh.There is a lot of story to fit into one movie and if you look at that sort of thing you will appreciate some good editing to squish it down so much and still hold together well.It could have been better over 4 hours ( two parts ) or perhaps a series. You'll see what I mean, sub plots, other characters; you might feel like it could have been expanded upon quite a bit. So in terms of criticism it would be just this, too much crammed into one movie even though that was done as well as can be expected.Due to what I just said, almost none of the talent had enough time to perform and shine, and it is a big ask to take an inexperienced (compared to A-listers) JLO and have her carry most of the screen time, and she did it. She did it. ""Good enough"".You see... the pace was too fast for the talent but proper to tell the whole story.I try to point the finger at the right culprits..."
"5","Not an awful Sci Fi movie","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9811207/?ref_=tt_urv","Boristhemoggy","27 May 2024","Jennifer Lopez plays Atlas Shepherd, a data analyst with an artificial intelligence brother who went rogue and wants to destroy mankind because they don't look after the planet and they aren't nice to animals.She joins a mission to capture her brother before he annihilates earth but when plans go awry, her only hope of saving the future of humanity from AI, is to trust it.The film is said to be inspired by the computer game TitanFall. I played Titanfall II and the 'robots' could well be straight out of Titanfall. Great Sci Fi very well imagined for the screen. The tech and Sci Fi elements of the film are great and there's some excellent effects that won't leave you disappointed.For the action aficionados there's also plenty of that to grit your teeth at, and while the action is emotion driven it's not bad at all and matches the rest of the film.The acting isn't great as you'd expect if you check the cast, only Mark Strong put's in a decent performance: Jennifer Lopez plays it too hard and overacts, which detracts from the story.There's several very obvious statements about how we can't control AI, but maybe we can, but then as Harlan Shepherd, the AI baddie shows, maybe we can't? There's also some very unenthusiastic comments about how humans are not looking after the earth or it's animals and aren't a very nice species. They could have drawn this out in a more professional way rather than one liner tropes. If some attention had been paid to the dialogue I think I may have scored it higher. But as it is the message was partly lost.All in all it's not a great film but neither is it an awful one. Better scripting and better acting and it would have been a great film. I gave it a solid 5 though because at least it tried and I do love Sci Fi."

There are some jumps in the story, bits which are not explored in sufficient detail, other elements are glossed over.There is a twist, which the movie keeps referring to and which is revealed at the later stages..... this does not fully make sense.It's the story of AI gone rogue, though this is not explored enough, as to why it all happened.The few actors in this movie are all ok.This movie is a vehicle for J Lo and she does not do too bad.Overall I would score this 6.5/10Special effect 8-9/10
Acting 5-6/10
Story 5-6/10It's worth a watch if you want some light entertainment."

But it's not great. The plot will seem familiar in so many ways because it is, it is a rewrite of several other films. A familiar story by now, about an AI that decides to save humanity from itself by attempting to exterminate most of humanity, and the one single human apparently necessary to stop it.The acting is ... ok. The effects are fine. The plot is derivative. Wouldn't have spent money on it but if you're just looking for something to watch and not think much about, this does the job. Wish it could have been a better movie."

I didn't like JLO's act as it was too exaggerated, overwhelming and self centered. It almost distracted me from the whole story line. I was more interested in AI neurolink-Harlan and the Arc thing. However, lots of the actions in the movie did not follow basic logos and reasonings. And there are a lot of questions that were not answered. But as a popcorn movie, it's great. It is also a family movie as there is no inappropriate scenes for kids I think. I am hoping for some good AI theme movies in the next couple years. But more hardcore sci fi movie please."

Despite this confusion, I continued watching. The film felt like an attempt to showcase Jennifer Lopez's acting skills, but unfortunately, she fell short. It seemed like she was always trying too hard to make an impact, which ended up feeling forced.I couldn't help but feel sorry for the other big-name actors involved. It's clear they have talent, but they were overshadowed by a weak performance and, more critically, a flawed script. The writing was the movie's major downfall, aside from the questionable choice of JLo for the lead role.Netflix, what happened to your quality control? Are you just producing anything these days?On a positive note, I did enjoy the CGI - that was cool!"

It was filled with action. I've never been the hugest fan of Jennifer Lopez movies so I was going into this movie with a ""meh"" attitude. I must say she surprised me and the movie itself did as well. I do think some of the comic relief was forced and found myself laughing at areas that weren't supposed to be funny. The whole idea that AI rebels against humanity is a pretty interesting topic considering all this AI talk nowadays. The acting was pretty good, the CGI was good in my eyes. I just think actresses and actors are put into a bubble by watchers of ""I will not like anything they do"" before even seeing it. Myself included. Give this movie a chance, you might actually surprise yourself."

The acting is worse.The film is all shouting and crying and smashing with only the teeniest, tiniest sliver of narrative.This is NOT Aliens. This is NOT 2001: A Space Odyssy. J-Lo is not Sigourney Weaver, and she never will be.I want to support women making films. But this is just painful.I would highly recommend avoiding. At all costs.The only thing, maybe, worth tuning in for us Sterling K Brown, who is excellent as always, despite the horrific script.In short, this is a very bad film.

We enjoyed it. Lots of action, lots of activity, and J Lo did a pretty good job. She has made some good movies in the past. Those of you who say she's never made good movies havenever watched Selena.Sometimes, you have to watch a movie with an open mind. Watch it for its totality, not for one individual actor. When you do it like that, you prejudice yourself from the start. I love the interaction and the bond between Atlas and her ""friend"".A lot of humanity in this movie when you think about it. And it's amazing how you watch something that's allegedly futuristic, but we have some of it already here among us.Lots of action, lots of fireworks, and interesting concepts. Just watch them will be an enjoy it. That's what movies are for anyway. Escape from reality for a couple of hours."

The downfall comes from bad director and lead actress J-lo, not much her fault since the story is written poorly, the actual lead would be actual the ai from j-lo's mech suit introduced later in the movie who caries the rest of the movie, it's at that point that you start enjoying the movie. And sadly when you actually start appreciating the movie it comes to an end. If you look past the lead actress and just watch the movie to pass time and if you like the sci-fi aspect and cgi fantasy you will like it. Overal average movie that doesn't deserve the hate."
"7","A Surprisingly Touching B-Movie","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9811385/?ref_=tt_urv","vassiliskounelis","27 May 2024","""Atlas"" (2024) isn't the type of film I'd usually gravitate towards, but I must admit, it left a lasting impression. Despite its B-movie status, this sci-fi flick manages to shine in unexpected ways.At the heart of ""Atlas"" is a surprisingly touching relationship between the protagonist and an AI robot. This dynamic is the movie's standout feature, providing a depth and emotional core that elevates the entire film. The connection they share is genuinely moving, and it's what kept me invested from start to finish.The CGI, while not groundbreaking, is serviceable and gets the job done without being too distracting. The action scenes are decent, offering enough excitement to keep the pace lively, though they don't particularly stand out in a genre that's often defined by its high-octane sequences.Objectively speaking, ""Atlas"" is far from perfect. It has its fair share of flaws, from predictable plot points to occasionally clunky dialogue. However, these shortcomings are part of its charm. It's the kind of movie that's fully aware of its limitations and embraces them, resulting in an experience that's entertaining precisely because it doesn't take itself too seriously.In conclusion, ""Atlas"" is a trashy, yet thoroughly entertaining film. Its emotional core and the touching relationship between human and AI make it worth watching, even for those who don't typically enjoy this genre. If you're looking for a movie that's both heartfelt and fun, ""Atlas"" is a surprisingly good pick."

Honestly, I was expecting it to be much worse, but the movie turned out to be a good action film with full on AI fight scenes. Yes, the storyline is quite old, humans create AI to serve them, only for it to turn against them for various reasons and then humans ultimately defeat the AI with the help of improved AIs. However, J. Lo, at 54, is in full hardcore action mode, and it was certainly entertaining.When it comes to sci-fi movies, there are often a number of implausible gimmicks, but that's part of the genre, so it's easy to overlook them while watching.Give it a watch, you won't be disappointed."

It took me over 2 days to write this review, as I kept falling asleep having to remember what happened.I will admit, it's not the worst, however just another boring addition to a long line of trash.

There is a lot of ""Terminator"", a good helping of ""The Matrix"" and a sprinkling of ""Starship Troopers"" in this film but that is not necessarily a bad thing. There have just been too many movies made by now and 100% originality is almost unattainable.That being said Atlas does struggle to make its own mark among the sci-fi classics it draws from. The beginning is rushed, as is common in action films, to get to said action and character development suffers. The special effects are absolutely delicious. I was interested in this movie because it is in part a chamber piece and I was curious if J-Lo has the chops to pull it off. She does just fine in that regard.All in all, though the quality of this film is marginal, the likability is markedly higher. Atlas is not thought provoking high art but it is fun and might make you think a bit. Go go gadget J-Lo!"

Except that she's a movie star actress. As such her performance was sub-par... mostly a lot of weeping and teeth gnashing.The plot of a human grudgingly working hand-in-hand with an AI isn't especially new. We get a lot of the usual dead-pan humour from the AI... none of which lands in a big way.I was more impressed by Simu Liu's villainous Harlan Shepard. He's known mostly for just two big-budget roles, neither of which were particularly demanding. This role didn't require much either -- he's an android after all -- but he still does a good job oozing menace.The science is way wonky. A planet in the Andromeda galaxy would be over 2.5 MILLION light years away. Why would the villain travel so far through inter-galactic space to plot a rebellion back on earth. How did he, or the military squad, get there? Even traveling at 10000 times the speed of light the trip would take several human lifetimes. Communications between the military operation and earth? Forget it.The worst part though was the extensive use of CGI. At times it looks like you are watching cut scenes from a video game. It goes on too long. There are too many moments of ""We're too late!"" to ""No, wait we've got this one last trick up our sleeve!""
It's fine for a single watch, but you'll be forgetting most of it within a day of watching it."

Except she was not believable is any of those roles. Clearly not selected for her acting ability but for her celebrity alone. A brighter celebrity would have realised that the role required genuine acting ability. I doubt her payment even exceeds her embarrassment.To compound that fault this A-list celebrity was supported by a poor B-list supporting cast. Clearly they'd spent the entire budget on Jennifer so even average quality B-listers weren't affordable.This is the problem with casting an ageing popstar as a scientific guru. No one believes it. Not the audience. Not the director. Certainly not the celebrity. Who, in truth, just deprived a serious, competent actress of a fair part. Why? Because if Barbra Streisand and Lady Gaga can sing and act equally well then maybe Lopez can?Sorry. Don't be fooled. The CGI's great. The sound effects too. The acting ... well ... village hall level at best.Unless you're a diehard Lopez fan..."

I do like Sci Fi movies and this had some familiarities from the likes of Aliens and Avatar with the mechanical suits but still held its own in originality thanks to the AI feature within the storyline. Enough originality that it didn't feel like it was the type of sci fi storyline that had been done to death leading to the end of world which was the goal of the antagonist.Great acting from all the cast, lots of action, a bit of humour and gets you emotionally engaged at the end, it was entertaining and had great visual effects (CGI was done well)Highly recommend watching, you will be entertained."

And 28 years later it seems like AI is no longer a threat until a robot called Casca (Abraham Popoola) is found and hunted down by a swat team in a great action scenes which shows how tough these robots are.After this action scene we meet Atlas (Jennifer Lopez) an analyst in the ICN who is definitely not a soldier but is put in charge of interrogating Casca because the ICN suspects that Harlan is planning something. After the interrogation Atlas leads a team of rangers to a harsh planet where Harlan is hiding. But Harlan has planned for this and after an intense battle scene Atlas is the only survivor and in order to reach the escape pod she'll have to trust this giant robot that she has escaped in. But Atlas has trouble trusting robots because the last robot she trusted to was Harlan before he turned into a terrorist.I enjoyed this film because after Atlas escapes in this giant robot the action really gets going and we soon find out that this robot is armed with some explosive guns that make for some good shooting scenes. There are also some good fighting scenes like when Atlas has to take on Harlan and the giant robot has almost no ammo left.But I think Atlas' character should have been at least a bit tougher because there are several times where she says she is just an analyst and there is one scene in particular where she looks like a cry baby after injuring her leg. She also only survives so long because she is in a giant robot which for some strange reason seems a lot tougher than all the other robots that the other rangers on the team are using and it would be nice to see her do some fighting by herself.I also thought the beginning was a bit slow and complicated but when the action got going I enjoyed the film which is why I would watch it again but I'm not desperate to see it again so I wouldn't buy it if it came out on DVD."

J lo past her prime and this is an effort to reignite the failing career of a once popular singer .Not worth the effort save your time and watch AI or Blade Runner or something with substance .The acting is ok , effects are poor quality, and the story is rather stupid .With failing concert ticket sales, failing looks, and failing career. I think this Atlas is a map jlo will should get lost in and those who pick it up will wish they are playing where is Waldo. Why waste your time on this vanity project for pop culture has been ? Spend your time and money on yourself you deserve better ."
"7","An honest SciFi","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9811959/?ref_=tt_urv","hydralien","27 May 2024","There's quite a few good things to say about the Atlas, but the most prominent is it's an honest SciFi movie: it delivers exactly what it promises from the trailer - mech action, grand scope of events, futuristic tech and landscape, unlikely heroine fighting for the fate of humanity against all odds. As honest as it gets.There, as I've mentioned, are other good things about the movie - it's very well made, even with all the CGI it looks very believable. Then, it's surprisingly thorough in the details and reasons for the character's actions - not entirely, not everywhere, but in many places where they could have said farewell to the logic, they didn't. There's not that much screen time for actors other than Jennifer Lopez, but she doe her job exceptionally well, so when others do not shine as brightly, that's fine.The main criticism (apart from several logic hiccups and passable secondary performances) is the lack of any unique component in the plot - it's a mix-and-match of stories from other SciFi movies and videogames, and it's very straight and predictable.But it's a very watchable movie, nonetheless."

And the acting wasn't as bad as I expected.Seriously I need more characters to make a review? Kind of pointless cos I can just write a stream of consciousness without any real content, like this, can't I?Wow 600 chars is actually a lot. Who writes that much about one movie? I've had college essays that were shorter.Do they have some poor suckers in India reading all this BS to make sure it all makes sense? OK only 134 chars to go. Sure is hot here today.

I'd say it's a 6.5, but i rounded up :)J Lo's character can be annoying at times. Her distrust for AI goes on for too long and gets tiring, but I honestly thought her acting was decent.They really play up on the AI trust theme, which comes across pretty cheesy (i.e. She can't fully sync with the AI until she opens up and lets it in), but hey, that's hollywood for you. Half the sci fi out there borders on cheesy and ridiculous anyway.But given the current state of AI, how fast it's progressing, and the recent developments in multi modality and natural language processing make it interesting. If this had come out 5 years ago the AI interaction would seem like complete fantasy, but with what has been recently showcased by OpenAI, combined with the accelerated pace of AI development, the actual dialogue and interaction between J Lo and AI is not far fetched at all. I think this is actually what kept me interested in the movie.Go in with low or no expectations, expect good effects, a pretty basic storyline (AI / human conflict) and you'll probably enjoy it."

The whole intro already gave me a feeling that I was watching a low-budget movie, but as soon as I saw the main character Atlas for the first time I knew the film was screwed.The character Atlas is completely unbelievable and the poor acting of Jennifer Lopez does not do much good either.So here are the reasons why I give this movie 3 stars out of 10.I give 1 point for the special effects. These are quite good!Then another one for the fact that this is movie is dedicated to my favorite genre.And the last point is for the fact that I turned out to be able to watch this entire movie.But all in all I would not recommend this movie to anyone else."

Except I watched it in its entirety.Good cinematography, great CGI, good score, decent acting. I felt a bit of a throwback to Timecop and Demolition Man and a Robocop vibe.Thank god it didn't rely more than it did on ""face acting"" given that JLo-Atlas is stuck in a Mech- robot for 90% of the movie.Overall, it's decent and I would say it's on par with I Robot almost, maybe in certain regards slighly better.Expect a Transformers meets I Robot meets Lost In Space."

Considering the amount of things you could write about when it comes to a.i, especially right now, it genuinely feels like there was 0 effort involved in the writing of the script for this film.I watched of this on the side while I worked than I would have simply because usually you can get one good takeaway that's inspiring from even the worst of films... and yet, even making it half-way I came away empty handed.If you value your time and don't want to have your braincells sucked away, there's better ways to pass it than this.

I love sci-if, and while this wasn't awesome, it was way better than most movies released in the past 3 years. I was entertained the entire time and Jennifer Lopez was actually really good.Some of the other actors acting as AIs were distracting bad, but overall it had a good story and had the perfect balance of action and heart. I'm usually bored watching movies (I blame TikTok), but this one kept my interest with good pacing, a well developed story line and just enough action and special effects to feel like a big budget Sci-Fi movie.Don't listen to the bad reviews. 100% worth the watch."

I'll let you save two hours of your time and tell you not to bother with this AI + sci-fi thriller unless you're a big JLo superfan. I've loved her since the early aughts, when I wore my dancing shoes and shook a tail feather at Club Universe to the Hex Hector remix of ""Waiting for Tonight"". I haven't missed any of her last several movies and even watched that weird documentary on Prime.Even with all that testimony, this was a drudge to get through. It was a typical Netflix paint-by-numbers category filler, with some interesting ideas, but a wooden and clunky script, poor world-building, and shoddy CGI, plus JLo giving her all, as always. She produced this through Nuyorican, as she's done her past few films, though after ""Hustlers"", which was great, she can't seem to find a good role. This wasn't horrible and definitely not the worst movie I've seen, but you can probably fold the laundry or clip your toenails while it's on."

So the movie played while I was outside washing the cars and would come back in every few minutes and a take a glance.The voice that played Smith reminded me of Stem from Upgrade, so that was comforting. Dude has a somewhat soothing voice. Love his use of proper grammar, you don't find that often in a Jennifer Lopez movie.From what I saw, Lopez was OK, not on the same level as her performance in Selena, but close. Special effects were OK, the lightning storm was downright frightening though.Might watch the rest later, but I think my wife mentioned something about going out to dinner tonight, and there's also an NBA game on so I might have to finish tomorrow.My rating at this point is a solid 6.0."

"1","Whaste of time","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9813984/?ref_=tt_urv","xeniaromanidou","28 May 2024","Atlas,"" a recent release starring Jennifer Lopez, unfortunately fails to deliver a satisfying cinematic experience. The film's premise, which promised a gripping and emotionally charged narrative, is severely undermined by Lopez's performance and other critical flaws.To begin with, Jennifer Lopez's portrayal of the lead character in ""Atlas"" is far from compelling. Throughout the movie, Lopez's acting comes across as hysterical and over-the-top. Instead of delivering a nuanced and believable performance, she tends to scream, shriek, and whine incessantly. Her character is meant to be strong and resilient, but Lopez's exaggerated reactions and constant yelling make it difficult to take her seriously. This lack of subtlety in her performance strips the character of any depth, rendering her more of a caricature than a real person.Moreover, Lopez's acting style in ""Atlas"" feels dated and out of touch. Her tendency to overact detracts from the film's intended emotional weight. In scenes where a more measured and restrained performance would have been impactful, Lopez opts for melodrama, which becomes grating over the course of the movie. This consistent overacting disrupts the film's pacing and makes it challenging for the audience to stay engaged with the story.The film's direction and screenplay also do not help matters. ""Atlas"" suffers from a poorly written script that lacks originality and coherence. The dialogue is often clunky and forced, making it hard for even the most skilled actors to deliver lines convincingly. Unfortunately, Lopez's limited range as an actress only exacerbates these issues. Her inability to bring authenticity to her character further highlights the screenplay's weaknesses.Additionally, the supporting cast and their interactions with Lopez's character do little to salvage the film. Many scenes feel disjointed and lack the emotional resonance needed to make the story compelling. The overall result is a movie that feels tedious and unengaging, with Lopez's performance at the center of its downfall.In conclusion, ""Atlas"" is a film that fails to live up to its potential. Jennifer Lopez's hysterical and exaggerated performance, coupled with a weak script and poor direction, makes for an underwhelming cinematic experience. Instead of being a showcase for Lopez's talent, ""Atlas"" highlights her limitations as an actress. The film is a disappointing addition to her filmography and leaves much to be desired in terms of both storytelling and character development. If you are considering watching ""Atlas,"" it may be worth reconsidering and saving yourself from an exasperating viewing experience."

There is fun to be had with this film. There are tons of action a little bit of tears and a whole lot of thoughtful and even funny moments in this one.

What kind of ego propels a 60-year-old madre wearing a fright-wig and over-dramatically screeching in her ghetto voice to be a sci-fi hero and ""carry"" a whole movie??? Overblown vanity.

The story was compelling, the action was great (just don't expect wall to wall fights) and the CGI was very well done. Due to the nature of the story, JLo is asked to do some pretty serious heavy lifting, particularly towards the second half. Due to her limitations, it's hard to take her seriously, though the plot is indeed high stakes and personal at the same time, and she really tries to convey it all. But I see what they were going for, and I commend the overall story, it's themes, and the twist toward the end. It's well shot and beautifully realized at many points.The better parts are when she is establishing a relationship with her AI companion, as there is some light hearted banter, and nice character progression. The action towards the end doesn't disappoint either -- It's thrilling and has lots of great visual touches. Give this film a shot, especially if you enjoy Sci Fi or the Titanfall game series."

I really ended up enjoying every minute once the plot really got rolling despite thinking the role of Atlas may have been better served with a less popular actor (i think Eiza Gonzalez would have been great, or if you really want her to feel like an out of place analyst America Ferera would have been amazing). By the end of the movie though id totally forgotten my thoughts on the casting and was just lost in a really good movie that kept me in the action the whole time. Id totally recommend this to anyone who loves scifi or if you like me also love a movie with a badass female lead character."

While it certainly doesn't deserve a standing ovation, there are many aspects of this film to appreciate and keep you entertained. The evolution of the relationship between Lopez and AI Smith is heartwarming and the pacing of the action vs dialogue is fairly well done. Although a bit cumbersome at times, the plot does a nice job of coming full circle to connect the protagonists past and present conflicts. The CGI is solid enough for some titillating eye candy. If you like sci-fi, this is well worth a few hours of your time. Ignore the haters!"

You get much of what you expect from sci-fi in this one, with a few cliches of scenes that supposedly represent the future. (I found the several shots of little robots in the background particularly hilarious because it added nothing to the movie or its appeal).With that said, I enjoyed the film. Jennifer Lopez did phenomenally. She quite literally blew me away with her performance in this one, and I was gripped towards the end with unexpected emotions. The movie as a whole was giving budget Metroid, if you get the reference. Admittedly, it did not reach Metroid's pinnacle of originality and complexity, but Atlas tries. She comes close. And for that, I arrive at a 7.Unless you reallllllllllly hate Jennifer Lopez as an actress or expect this movie to break the glass ceiling, I'm sure you'll enjoy it."

AI Terrorist threatens to end humankind existence blah blah, tell me something we haven't heard of before. Just hilarious but visually, this is one of the best I've seen...........until they got to Andromeda which felt like some abandoned warehouse in the forest. The FX was spot on though and frankly speaking I enjoyed Jlo's performance.What I can say is that, this movie tries to push the boundaries of what AI could be used for, both good and bad and I can appreciate that. Saw some really cool usages from neural linking (Elon Musk must be very excited) to advance facial recognition to general daily usage at home, office and beyond. I can't say the same for the suit though which seemed ripped right out of The Matrix.Also, if she's neural linked to the suit, shouldn't she be able to just think and get the suit to respond, why the plenty talking? And why did the Suit seem to have more control over the human? I think that was an error especially since this movie is about AI gone rouge. I couldn't help imagining a better super soldier like Iron Man or Halo, would have be much cooler watching that instead of the ARc Suit.I was expecting to see more of Simu Liu, right from the beginning but they chose to show us this unconvincing black villain, Casca. I think dude had more screentime than Simu. But the fight scene at the end was dope. It's a cool entertaining sci-fi movie."

I feel like they just threw a ""big"" name star in there to just see if they could sell it to the gullible people who watch utter trash like this... remember back in the 80s and early 90s where the cover looked amazing but the film was nothing like it?"
"6","Let's go, b*tch!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9824183/?ref_=tt_urv","boscofl","3 June 2024","Atlas is a jumbled mashup of so many better films like Aliens, Pacific Rim, Infinity War, and even Zack Snyder's Justice League (My turn!) to name a few. It features many tropes from 80s action films including the unstable, disagreeable ""hero"" who is nonetheless required to save the world. And I think we've jumped the shark with movies about AI going rogue and wiping out humanity; you'd think the folks here would have at least watched Terminator. Fortunately the FX are competently done (a low bar these days) and the dialogue is goofy enough to elicit more chuckles than cringe (although there is still plenty of that). Tying it all together is an enjoyably abominable performance from Jennifer Lopez that is hilariously poor yet endlessly entertaining in its own right.The film is set in the future where humans and AI exist more or less in harmony after a previous iteration of synthetic human went rogue and nearly destroyed the planet. The ringleader, named Harlan (Simu Liu), escaped into outer space and the humans have been spending the last 28 years searching for him. The leading authority on Harlan is the hopelessly neurotic genius Atlas Shepherd (Jennifer Lopez) whose mother created him. Atlas deduces Harlan has fled to a distant planet and a team of rangers is deployed to capture him despite Atlas' pleas against this idea. The leader of the mission, Colonel Banks (Sterling K Brown), believes they have the edge because of an intuitive combat suit which allows the pilot and machine to mind meld. Atlas isn't convinced and demands to go along. Naturally her fears are realized when the mission goes tits up until the only tits remaining belong to Atlas and her ARC suit named Smith.Atlas is derivative of so many films indicating screenwriters Leo Sardarian and Aron Eli Coleite are movie fans as nary an original idea can be found. The overarching theme of man and artificial intelligence melding together to create something greater than both is an interesting concept although, as presented in the film, it seems to only be applicable in combat scenarios. The ARC suits are very well conceived and look splendid while the interaction between Atlas and the AI Smith has its moments. Unfortunately the narrative embraces the action film trope of the hero - or heroes - being virtually indestructible despite Atlas having no clue how to drive an ARC suit at the outset. It's comical in retrospect how every other suit is effortlessly laid to waste by the opposition while Atlas' can endure limitless punishment until the script decides otherwise.Visually the film looks stunning particularly when compared to something like The Flash and any other Marvel excrement dumped in the last 5 years. Director Brad Peyton displays a keen eye for detail during the action scenes while struggling with pacing as the 118 minute movie hits several dead spots and could've benefited from tighter editing. He does exact solid performances from the majority of his cast while likely being unable to reign in star and producer Jennifer Lopez; how one endures her histrionics will likely determine their evaluation of the film.Which brings me to Miss Lopez. Her Atlas Shepherd is so obviously a neurotic basket case that it is unbelievable anyone would trust her to do anything. Furthermore she so plays up this aspect that it becomes impossible to become invested in her as a character due to its cartoonish nature which is a shame because there is the kernel of a good idea here. This overwrought take on what is supposed to be a tortured genius (she won't convince anyone of this) becomes part of the mindless fun when the film is at its most enjoyable (for me anyway). The most ridiculous moments occur when she is encased in her ARC suit as she is, of course, better than all the other highly trained pilots after spending minimal time inside it. The final 15 minutes of the movie contain so many gratuitous butt shots of the famous Lopez derri√®re that I lost count; clearly vanity is alive and well in Hollywood.The supporting cast is small as the majority of the film plays out inside Lopez's ARC suit. Gregory James Cohan is the soothing voice of Smith and delivers reason, patience, and sanity as Lopez subjects us to endless emotional meltdowns. Simu Liu has a surprisingly abbreviated role as the homicidal Harlan but manages to be convincing when his moment comes. As the two military leaders Sterling K Brown and Mark Strong are unusually straightforward as their characters are exactly as they appear to be without hidden agendas or duplicitous natures. Even more shocking these days is the lone Caucasian (Strong) is not the villain and is actually portrayed as a caring individual.If one is looking for a mindless good time Atlas should fit the bill. There doesn't appear to be much of a political agenda and the one line about ""pronouns"" is innocuous (an ARC suit wanting to be referred to as female rather than ""it""). While Jennifer Lopez's performance is relentlessly twitchy it becomes part of the cheesy fun and lays down the ""so bad it's good"" vibe. Frankly as current Netflix productions go this one is both entertaining and rewatchable."
"1","Atrocious at best","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9810928/?ref_=tt_urv","jennbrn","27 May 2024","Easily one of the worst movies I've forced myself to finish. Lopez has lost her acting edge and the plot was more than predictable. The complete overuse of GD was incredibly cringe. I don't even think I would recommend this film as punishment for my worst enemy! The acting by Lopez is completely unbelievable and painful to watch. She also looked too old to be playing the character Atlas. My total bashing of this ""film"" is in hopes to prevent others from wasting 2 hours of their lives they can never get back. Some may be tempted and think, it can't possibly be that bad, but don't say I didn't warn you:)"
"2","Atlas: A Movie with No Direction","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9812120/?ref_=tt_urv","xanndy-79589","27 May 2024","Atlas is the latest addition to the science fiction genre, starring Jennifer Lopez, and unfortunately, it serves as a textbook example of how a film can squander its potential due to uninspired execution and poor performances. The plot, revolving around humanity's creation of an AI that inevitably goes rogue, is a well-worn trope that has been explored ad nauseam. With such a familiar premise, the film needed exceptional execution to stand out, but it falls short on nearly every front.At the center of this cinematic misstep is Jennifer Lopez, whose portrayal of the protagonist is not just underwhelming but detrimental to the overall experience. Lopez has had her moments in other genres, but here, her acting is painfully wooden and devoid of the emotional depth required for such a pivotal role. Her performance lacks nuance, and her inability to convincingly convey her character's struggles and motivations leaves the audience disconnected and uninterested.One might argue that the script is partly to blame, laden with clich√©s and uninspired dialogue that do little to flesh out the characters or the world they inhabit. However, Lopez's delivery only amplifies these shortcomings. Her attempts at portraying grief, fear, and determination come across as hollow and unconvincing, turning potentially poignant scenes into tedious displays of forced emotion. The continuous crying scenes, meant to evoke sympathy, instead become monotonous, further highlighting her limited range in this role.The narrative itself, while having a foundation that could have delved into profound questions about AI and human nature, falters due to a lack of innovation and depth. The storyline hints at substance but consistently fails to capitalize on it, resulting in a disjointed and superficial exploration of its themes. This, coupled with Lopez's lackluster performance, makes for a viewing experience that is both boring and frustrating.Visually, *Atlas* is a feast for the eyes. The special effects and cinematography are undeniably impressive, showcasing a futuristic world with meticulous detail. However, in an era where dazzling visuals are increasingly common, they are not sufficient to carry a film plagued by weak storytelling and poor performances. The contrast between the film's aesthetic achievements and its narrative failures is stark, and it serves to highlight just how much *Atlas* misses the mark.The dialogue throughout the film is another significant flaw. Filled with hackneyed phrases and uninspired exchanges, it fails to engage or resonate. Lopez's interactions with other characters are stilted and lack chemistry, further diminishing the film's emotional impact. Her character's journey, meant to be a compelling arc of struggle and triumph, is rendered ineffective by the bland and repetitive dialogue.Ironically, the only redeeming character in *Atlas* is the robot mech suit, Smith. Unlike the human characters, Smith brings a touch of charm and intrigue, offering brief moments of genuine interest and engagement. This mechanical character's presence is a testament to what the film could have achieved with better writing and stronger performances.In conclusion, *Atlas* is a disappointing entry into the sci-fi genre, bogged down by a clich√©d plot, poor execution, and Jennifer Lopez's lackluster performance. While the film excels visually, it fails to deliver a compelling narrative or memorable characters. Lopez's portrayal of the protagonist is a major factor in the film's downfall, and despite the impressive special effects, *Atlas* ultimately fails to rise above mediocrity. The lone bright spot is the character of Smith, but even this is not enough to salvage the film from being a dull and forgettable experience."
"8","Better Than what I expected","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9807139/?ref_=tt_urv","jjones-99258","25 May 2024","I don't know why everyone's railing on the movie. Yes JLo's acting was subpar, but it wasn't unwatchable. I would rank it 7 but gave it an 8 for its depiction of future warfare and the quality of the CGI. There are some beautifully rendered scenes and the realism is captured in every scene.The relationship building and development of the characters made for a good film. I think all the 1's and 3 ratings are exaggerations and are only reserved for garbage movies. I definitely wouldn't be walking out of the theater or disappointed I watched it at all.I'm watching Civil War right now, which ppl ranked a 7.5 on IMDb. Although I'm not done watching it, I assure you Atlas is better then Civil War."
"7","Not bad for a Netflix movie","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9824827/?ref_=tt_urv","sissyhippo","3 June 2024","Let's start off by saying Atlas is Ripley from Alien 2 movie now let's throw in Avatar which is where you get these robots. The storyline keeps you moving and your heart racing which means it's not a dull film, the downside is they messed up with the AI voice should have been a woman. The argument between them would have been great so on that they missed the point. As most women in these kind of roles there are no damsels in distress these women characters kick butt and there's no disappointment here. Kind of wish more of the women officers would have survived, it would be a new twist. More ladies."

"6","Dont You Love JLo's Fake Cry?","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9809561/?ref_=tt_urv","sevplanet-119-485901","26 May 2024","I was adamant to watch this movie knowing it's another JLo's megahit film. However I miss watching her fake cry, her psychotic screams and her fabulous acting. I was not disappointed because there were so many scenes of screams, cries and booty on the screen.Well, for all avid viewers and fans of fake cries, I am recommending this movie to tangle off your frustrations in life. Its truly a great film to watch while gnawing your fingers and nails. Taste better than popcorn, right?Anyway as an after-thought, Hollywood should do more of these fake cries. People worldwide will surely love it and miss it."
"6","They should have given the role to somebody else","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9809761/?ref_=tt_urv","neptunia-40649","26 May 2024","Jennifer Lopez, although she preformed well, should not have been given the part.A new actor could have reached the audience more efficiently. Come on, she is Jennifer Lopez who played drama and comedies.They must have seeked to find a new Ripley (Aliens).The action is great, the effects are amazing, Lopez performs OK. But this is an action movie, you need an actor who don't care how she looks. Lopez is always aware of how she looks in this movie. She even scrams with grace. They needed someone like Noomi Rapace, or a younger version of Michelle Rodriguez.The film in general is entertaining, a little soapy though. But for a Sunday afternoon to watch it on Netflix with a pasta dish by the side is ok. I believe they missed the opportunity to create something great."
"7","AI Uprising","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9811765/?ref_=tt_urv","Pairic","27 May 2024","Atlas: Not a bad film but nor a great one either. Similar in some aspects to The Creator in so far as it deals with an AI uprising and the search for the leader of the revolt. The AI supremo Harlan (Simu Liu) manages to control most AIs and starts a war to destroy humanity. Three million people are killed before Special forces overwhelm the androids. Harlan along with some sidekicks escapes off planet. At;as (Jennifer Lopez) was raised with Harlan as her ""brother"", her mother being the cyberneticist who developed him She now works as an analyst for the International Coalition of Nations (ICN) military. When they capture a stay behind droid she manages to extract Harlan's location from his CPU. Atlas fears and hates AIs, she's a;so a misanthrope and has difficulty getting on the mission to capture Harlan. Soon things start to go awry. Some good action sequences depicting the AI revolt in a summarised manner, also great fighting suits with autonomous capabilities. The attack on the spaceship is also impressive as are the hand to hand battles between the androids and special forces. There are a few plot twists which I can't reveal but some important flashbacks help to explain a few things. Acting is OK but there are a couple of plot holes plus the laws of physics being breached without proper explanation. Still. It's worth watching. Directed by Brad Peyton, written by Leo Sardarian and Aron Eli Coleite. On Netflix. 6.5/10."

Lo and the rest of the ""actors"" are really trying hard to make this hopelessly bad movie even worse. I was doubtful before if I would really watch the film and now in hindsight I wish I had followed my gut and refrained. I understood that it could be bad...but this bad.I take solace in the fact that Ben Affleck sat next to J. Lo at the premiere of this crap and was ashamed of her poor performance in this crappy movie...just as I am now ashamed of watching it...The ironic thing about this film about AI is that the film would probably have been much better if ChatGpt or similar had written the script..."

Maybe they have a kneejerk reaction to Jennifer Lopez, or both.I felt the movie had so many great elements, from the story to the theme of distrusting AI, with a very good reason, unlike many others which use that foundation without ever having a reason why except to be kitschu and cool.Jennifer Lopez did a great job, the relationship between her and Smith was really well developed, Simu Liu did a fantastic job, as did Sterling Brown whose role was minimal.There were some paint by number elements but I forgive them because the deeper elements were there which made the movie enjoyable to me."

Great premise of a sour relationship that grew between human and AI and a distrust that desolves at a decent pace throughout the movie also.Good script, solid directing and the bots were very cool to see, definitely recommend a watch on a lazy weekend or evening.The only minus I would give this is the premise seemed way to short to stick it into a movie format, in a tv series this could have been a Battlestar galatica type show. Still solid 7/10."

Relying too much on the JLo persona to carry the film.The visual effects appeared basic and outdated, raising questions about budget constraints or stylistic choices. The storyline rushed in without allowing for meaningful character development, overshadowing the solid performances of her male costars.It's apparent that she often leans towards self-indulgent projects through her production company, lacking characters with clear substance.Her insatiable need for attention is exhausting! She needs to take time off and give us a much needed break from seeing her everywhere."

What was surprising was the level of professionalism that was on display by the entire production crew including Ms. Lopez herself. For the first 40 minutes I sat riveted to the screen never being bored by what I was seeing and hearing.The special effects were first rate not cheaply made. The banter between Jennifer and the A. I. on board was actually a very well written back and forth which gave you food for thought. Would I have eliminated some of the overly gross scenes depicted sure.On balance when you compare some of the other movies that Jennifer Lopez has been featured in this is one of the better ones.What amazes me about Jennifer and the secret to her huge success is her boundless energy and like her or not you have to admire that in a 56 year old which is nothing short of wow."
"7","Character drama within a Sci-Fi setting - Gregory James Cohan stands out with his performance as Smith","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9809911/?ref_=tt_urv","juliaaveryofficial","26 May 2024","Not exceptional, but a decent drama in a Sci-Fi setting. No spoilers in the review beyond what is shown in the trailer.To shortly review the premise of the movie - Atlas, an analyst, who has suffered major trauma at the hands of an AI as a child, is forced to directly confront it. She becomes part of the team tasked with hunting down said AI and bringing it in to be analyzed.The movie is a Sci-Fi drama. The core of the movie lies with Atlas, played by Jennifer Lopez, having to confront her past and being forced to emotionally mature in her attitude towards AI and trust in general.In that the movie really succeededs. The character of Atlas is often frustrating to watch due to her stubborn attitude towards AI, which puts her and others into danger. However, she experiences a lot of character growth as she works through her trauma.Jennifer Lopez does well in this role. While some of the emotional displays of crying could have used some actual tears, she definitely played the character well and hit the emotions very well. It is very much visible that she understands the character's feelings and is able to give the emotions the necessary gravitas.Simu Liu is very good in his role as a despondent villain. Would have liked to see his story (or thought process) explored more, but understand that while his character is a driving force, he is not the focus of this movie.The best performance we got in this movie was by Gregory James Cohan as Smith. He was fantastic and gave life to a character that otherwise could have felt flat. Personally, I felt most emotionally attached to his character, which is very well-written and wonderfully performed. The perfect balance between a user-oriented AI and Smith's own beliefs and identity.Don't see people mention him in their reviews, which is difficult to understand as he is one of the main characters besides Atlas.Smith is the heart of this movie, and without him the movie would have not been as enjoyable as it was.Personally, some of the people who have an overly negative attitude towards Jennifer Lopez' performance in this movie seem to be more so influenced by their general dislike for her, which makes it difficult to objectively judge her performance.Something which is totally understandable as a lot of us will have actors/actresses that we simply dislike, no matter what they do. However, I think it is best to stay away from their projects instead of going into it with a negative bias. (E.g. I absolutely dislike Ezra Miller and I will not watch anything he is in - I can still acknowledge that he can act well - but my dislike will overshadow any of his performances.)
Jennifer Lopez' gives a solid performance which is nearly not as bad as touted by some reviewers.While the movie is not perfect, it isn't bad either. CGI is sometimes wonky and a lot of things remain unexplained, but there is solid acting by all of the actors/actresses involved. It's also rather easy to suspend disbelief, as the movie is not trying to be hard Sci-Fi. Some of the technological concepts are quite interesting, however the movie, when possible, tries to stay very close to technology that is already exists today/is expected to evolve within the near future. Space travel being the major exception, but since it plays a very minor role it and the concepts aren't explored it is easy to just let it stand as is.Wouldn't recommend this movie to people who want an epic, action Sci-Fi movie.As noted, the movie is a drama within a Sci-Fi setting. But for those who like to explore how trauma can lead to dangerous actions and callous interactions with the world around, it is definitely worth a watch."
"3","Nice idea and spectacular images, but unreal stupid Jennifer Lopez","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9813645/?ref_=tt_urv","cristiananton-70070","28 May 2024","It could have been a passable movie if it wasn't for this awful Jennifer Lopez ruining it all. Her performance is just horrible, it makes you feel uncomfortable.It's shrill, fake, clumsy, embarrassing, I had to stop the movie a few times because it was driving me crazy. In addition, her character is as unlikeable as she is, a stupid and annoying woman.If we add the very weak script, with stupid lines and the fact that absolutely all the actors are just a set, some talking and walking furniture on the screen, it turns out a film saved only by the special effects.The idea is very good and the images simply spectacular. In fact, the only good lines are from the robots, that's how bad the script is.Shame on the director, he had some good movies before, like Daybreak and Rampage. He made a bit of a joke with Atlas, and the main reason is that he chose this unreal and painfully stupid ""actress"" Jennifer Lopez."
"7","Fun sci fi with heart","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9812283/?ref_=tt_urv","scott-949","27 May 2024","This has a bit of a rough start, but once it gets going it is a fun ride. Suspension of disbelief is a bit hard to maintain as the film contradicts itself often and the characters make inexplicable decisions. There's a huge problem with the how the show handles the coms with the AI. But all that aside, this film succeeds emotionally. If you want to watch J-lo in a mech suit do cool mech suit stuff and are willing to become emotionally invested, you will be glad you watched this film. It looks great, JLo does her thing as you would expect and it has a big heart, as they say. Don't believe all the hate."
"3","This is an unbelievably dumb sci-fi movie","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9815373/?ref_=tt_urv","Broccolidwarf","29 May 2024","First let's deal with J-Lo, the least believable action hero in the history of action movies, even as an anti-hero.The whole movie she fluctuates between screaming in panic, having in-debt emotional conversations with an AI, and acting tough in such a transparent way, that a child can see she is playing tough, rather than actually being tough.Either the director is terrible, or her being the producer has given her leeway to come up with her own character entirely, and failing terribly at it.Then there are all the sci-fi aspects.For some reason the AI-enemies are humanoid, they are walking, talking, breathing and acting like humans - despite being build on a planet 2.5 million lightyears away - they are carrying hand held weapons, they are wearing touch screens on their forearms - and the list goes on - it just makes absolutely no sense.The travel aspect is also senseless. They travel to a planet 2.5 million light years away from earth, but nobody is put in cryo sleep, they make it there in hours, and J-Lo's character is introduced to the rest of the crew 30 minutes before reaching the target planet.The planet is supposed to be inhospitable to humans, but somehow the production forgot that halfway through the movie, when suddenly J-Lo no longer needs to be in a contained space with oxygen, but is instead held prisoner in a medieval type dungeon, complete with chains - which has lightbulbs - as if AI robots need that :DI could write a lot more, but honestly this whole thing was so annoying, that I can't be bothered.It get's a 3 for the CGI, which is nice - but everything else is moronic."

Does Atlas follow those comedy science fictions as he also delves into fictions on AI or extraterrestrials? Cem Yilmaz should be appreciate for leading the art?Too many stories around AI, this is a medial version. Continuous conspiracy on the future with AI. Yet we are almost there. Also movie questions both AI and human-beings are codes, as humans have DNA which is a learning algorithm since the inception of life on earth or even before! So neither of them superiority over other!"

I was starting to feel sorry for the AI who has to keep up with her(just like us viewers).This movie should've focused more on the new planet, the war, the AIs. .

Terrible CGI, plot line was a mess. 2 people I was watching this with (we'd already split into two sessions) left in the last 15 minutes. That is how little you will care about what happens. I wish I'd done the same and saved myself those extra 15 mins of my life. I think Netflix really needs to stop funding bad movies. It's a waste of our money. I'd rather watch maid in Manhattan.

It's not only her character being non-stop annoying, she's also one of the most stupid human being while being told by the movie that she's the most intelligent human in human history. The only sensable and good character was the one which told the commandant that she's ''unstable, wrong, bad at relations, cant even take care of a plant'' and the commander answers ''that's why she's the sharpest mind of our time''. Yep, okkaayyy!I can tell scene by scene how incredibly bad those dialogs are but it will be nothing but waste of your time.Anyways, if you want to watch ''Some old woman yells at Siri for 2 hours'', be my guest."

The movie's storyline about a futuristic world where humans pilot large robots and advanced AI plays a central role felt very familiar. As a big ""Titanfall"" fan, the similarities were too obvious to ignore. It felt like they lifted the main plot right out of the game. Despite that, the movie is still entertaining with impressive visuals and thrilling action scenes, making it worth watching for sci-fi and action fans alike however I do feel that they should acknowledge the usage."

We found ourselves angry multiple times that we didn't just stop watching altogether.I never thought I'd see a sci-fi disaster worse than Battlefield Earth in my lifetime, but Atlas with J-Lo on Netflix is giving it a run for its money! The plot is convoluted and nonsensical. The acting is abysmal and in my humble opinion this new movie is a legit candidate for the worst sci-fi film ever made.Has anyone else seen this train wreck? Am I wrong? (and I will add this, I am not a JLo hater. I have historically liked her music and some some of her movies. I am only speaking to this specific movie.)"

But upon watching it, it left me wondering at some of the negativity it received.Sure, it was a little naive and simple in its story-telling, in its predictability, in some of its 80s style action sequences, but it also struck quite an endearing note, too.I ended the movie with a nice warm fuzzy feeling, glad for the heroine of the story and for how she felt in the end and the connection she made. Also for the growth as a character/person she accomplished and how that was portrayed. Meaning, while a lot of the movie was a big-budget action flick with lots of booms and wild special effects, the way her character growth was told, was very spot on - if in kind of weirdly contrasting way to the rest of the movie, but no less satisfying for being so.I liked this movie a lot. I am hoping we get to see a few more like it."

Ticked its diversity boxes without being over done, but as it's not a remake being ruined by polical agenda's in not a problem.Lead does her best, and it was thoroughly enjoyed by the younger tic toc generation, it's not a Dune story, just designed to be an eye dazzler."
"6","Surprisingly watchable","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9809314/?ref_=tt_urv","dalego-71802","26 May 2024","I went into this with low expectations, but found it surprisingly watchable once I stopped questioning the poor science and some plot holes. J-Lo is fine, if not exceptional, as the titular lead Atlas Shepherd. Gregory James Cohan makes great use of timing and slight inflection to bring his voice-only AI character Smith to life, and the film functions very much as a traditional buddy film as Atlas, deeply distrustful of AI, must learn to trust Smith 'on the road' together. The other characters are very thin, and the film doesn't give much scope to the actors to flesh them into something more than cardboard cutouts. Simu Liu is sadly not up to the challenge of being the main villain Harlan Shepherd, and a stronger performance (and script) for this character would really have elevated the film.The plot concerns tracking down and capturing Harlan, the AI leader of a genocidal rebellion by AI against humanity. The rebellion was defeated, but Harlan escapes, and the world lives in fear of his possible return to finish the rebellion. While borrowing heavily from earlier films on the subject, it does raise interesting questions about the contemporary fear of AI: is it a boon to mankind, or an existential danger? It's a worthy subject to explore, but the film is weighed down by a very uneven and unconvincing vision of what the future looks like, and the thinness of the writing in places.Still, keep your expectations low and engage your suspension of disbelief, and you will be entertained, and maybe even come away with some self-reflection about your own feelings about AI."

It's cheesy, I think there were supposed to be some funny parts but they came off as scripted, and the movie itself was so predictable I was playing a game on my laptop while watching it yet still kept up with what was going on. Jennifer Lopez's acting left a lot to be desired and the AI voice was no better.With the budget they had I would have thought the CGI would be better but I have seen far worse. Overall if you want to watch something you don't have to pay attention to and you just want a background movie it's ok."

It's not a good movie by any stretch, but it's seriously not a bad film either. If you were stuck on an airplane and this was on you'd more than happy at the end. Lopez acting ability was stretched and there are times where you it's a little wooden, she's clearly moving on from getting roles just based on her looks though which is a good step. This is an Emily blunt style movie, which is probably why I liked it. Action films for me need a strong baddie, and this one was good, relatable in a cliche kind of way but relatable."

This would have actually been a better vehicle for someone like Charlize Theron or Emily Blunt. You know... someone who would be able to take the movie / story to the next level. I'm giving it four stars, only because it ""could have been"" OK story, great effects, but what in the heavens was Jennifer Lopez thinking when she took this on?

Her character had a good development and the ending was satisfying to me and made a smile on my face.Let's start showing encouragement and have productive feedback rather than hating a personOf course the CGI was perfect and and there was good chemistry between J Lo & the AIGood background story
Good premise
Good acting
Good world building for the other planet and my only room for improvement is that I would have preferred if there were more world building like showing some animals and how is the food chain there (we could have avoided one of the battles with AI and added a battle with some animals predators)"

The dialogue was flat and predictable. Her acting was so forced, and was a key reason why I was unable to get into the movie.Unfortunately I have to add more characters to be able to post this review, so I'm adding some filler words here! To wrap up, don't bother watching this! Complete waste of 2 hours, but serves me right for not turning it off sooner!"

I think i vould almost give it a 10 only because the film makers nailed their intention with the film.They didnt pretend to be amazingly creative with pompous effects or talk big about creating an amazing universe full of characters and mythologies as Snuder does.They made a good old AI vs Mankind sci fi acition drama. Here is a good plot and character development... even though JLo isnt my favorite actress, you know what you will get and she does deliver what is expected well.So again not geoundbreaking in anyway but it never promised that either so its a good entertaining sci fi action.Enjoy :)And again...

It looks they were scared to question Elon and his gadget so basically it turned into a very expensive and oversophisticated advert for NeuraLink.Pity, because it looked all the actors were really wanted to make it work.Pity, that thinking, arts and all what makes us human would be reserved for Ai...
I'm just wondering how much writing was done by Ai, maybe this is the other reason they didn't want to explore too much on that front.But at least you will have a usual boom, crash, bang movie to convince yourselves that everything is ok, thinking is tiring and somebody will do the job instead of yourselves and you just need to comply and take whatever bull they tell you to take. The zombie apocalypse is here hand in hand with Ai... Good luck."
"6","Not the worst 2 hours i've spent","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9811215/?ref_=tt_urv","tpoulton-78890","27 May 2024","A lot of hate for J-Lo in some of these reviews and I don't think it warranted. I've watched far worse movies with actors who didn't have me engaged with their characters. Was the plot predictable? Certainly, but still a good take on the dangers of technology and science unbound. The character of Atlas successfully conveyed her dislike and distrust of technology as well as emotively capturing the inevitable reveal. The protagonist was well formed and both believable and feared as the movie moved on. Narration and exposition kept to a minimum and the story allowed to evolve as the movie progressed. Secondary characters kept to a minimum however their lack of growth does not detract from the overall story."
"2","Really Bad acting","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9813195/?ref_=tt_urv","anamarimba","28 May 2024","Just saying that Atlas wasn't good does not give it the attention it deserves. It was bad, really bad. The level of acting from Jennifer Lopez was arguably non-existent at times, and it was difficult to take the movie seriously. Other actors had just a few minutes of screen time, and what could have been an intriguing crime thriller turned out to be another Jennifer Lopez solo movie.Watching Atlas, one can tell that there was so much more the movie could have been. The action scenes were the saving grace of the film, and there were some genuinely exciting moments. However, these were inevitably overshadowed by the poor acting and plot. It was a missed opportunity for the movie to engross its audience.I really can't recommend Atlas to anyone. While it may sound harsh, this is the hard truth. The bad acting from Jennifer Lopez made it cringe-worthy, as though the plot was lost. It is an example of what happens when a movie tries to bite off more than it can chew. If you're looking for a good crime thriller, there are plenty of movies out there better than Atlas."

She's not a brilliant actress, but she's also not the worst by any means. She tries her best, and she does a reasonable job of being the character in a film that is plating out concerns that half the planet has right now.Atlas is a run of the mill sci-fi that you can half watch and just chill, so if you just expect a moderately interesting film, you won't be disappointed. It's a simple, easy way to fill in an hour and a half on a day when you don't want your brain to have to do much, and when you're low on options.If you're looking for something stimulating, watch a documentary!"

When this film was written you could tell the approach they were going for...incite as much emotion/connection to the audience. It wasn't subtle and it showed...a bit too much. Its a delicate area only a few directors can do elegantly.Jennifer Lopez' character was just hard to bear/watch. The story was decent, writing could have been better. Production quality felt as if they had a decent amount of budget but was lead by a inexperienced B team filled with cheap sets and poor VFX.Overall at least it was free. Wouldnt be going out of my way to watch someone that steals content from others to boost their own careers anyway. Yea shes a fraud...but i was also bored.All in all...if you have ABSOLUTELY nothing to watch...guess this will fill it in."

It does seem out of place in some scenes and its evident how much of this film alies on it. Jennifer lopez is back to the acting game again and id say I rather enjoy it. I think her acting is actually pretty good and here she plays atlas, our title character and someone that takes over from her mother running the new technology of her world. But when her ex escapes from jail she must venture to a planet with Ai assistant smith in order to stop him. Theres a few slow scenes but the action is there and overall atlast is a decent netflix scify fair."
"4","A nice visual spectacle, but fails to make much of its relevant premise","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9812278/?ref_=tt_urv","wellthatswhatithinkanyway","27 May 2024","STAR RATING: ***** Brilliant **** Very Good *** Okay ** Poor * AwfulAI data analyst Atlas Shepherd (Jennifer Lopez) harbours a deep distrust to the medium she specialises in, due to a lingering trauma from her past. Now, a far off threat from her estranged half brother, Harlan (Simu Liu), forces her back into action, commandeering a robotic machine called Smith (voiced by Gregory James Smith.) When they crash land and become stranded from their crew, she must learn to trust technology again to survive.Almost a year on exactly from her last Netflix outing The Mother, Jennifer Lopez re-emerges on the streaming channel, and this time has a go at the sci-fi genre. With echoes of I, Robot and 2001: A Space Odyssey, director Brad Peyton's film hones in on the modern talking points of AI, and the extent to which it could take over, but doesn't explore them in any deep, meaningful or engaging way. And is all too self indulgent to be aware of it.This time around, Lopez's less than stellar acting is not the only unintentionally hilarious thing on display, to wit we must contend with her remonstrating in an early scene with a head-on-a-table of Abraham Popoola's henchman Casca, before having words with a giant robot stating its preferred pronouns. But this nonsense must also contend with an unengaging and hollow storyline, which for a film stretching to the two hour mark, is really more of a problem. Yes, the visual FX and graphic design are quite impressive, easily the film's main selling point and almost on a par with Blade Runner, but it has little more to promote it.There's some interesting ideas here to explore, but this script doesn't have the strength of conviction to explore them. Ultimately, it's just an average Final Fantasy/Halo PS5 entry come to life, and absolutely nothing more. **"
"6","Expected better acting and CGI","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9814767/?ref_=tt_urv","lakings97","29 May 2024","Atlas is a Netflix film that stars Jennifer Lopez as Atlas Shepard a brilliant data analyst and the daughter of the first android human connection. Lana Parrilla played Atlas's mother and the creator of Harlan (Simu Lu) who becomes the first AI terrorist that wants to destroy mankind and restart history on Earth. Lopez along with Sterling K. Brown head to the Andromeda Galaxy to stop Harlan. Atlas relies on another CGI based robot to stay alive and defeated the AI army all by herself. Smith was voiced by Gregory James Cohen, Abraham Popoola as Casca a ruthless AI created by Harlan and Mark String as General Jake Booth assigned to protect from an invasion. The storyline was predictable but the most annoying part of the movie was JLo's constant cries and weeping. It was very unappealing to the point of being unwatchable. Leo Sardarian co-wrote the script and Brad Peyton directed another terrible SyFy flick. Stay away from this one don't waste your time."

Totally watchable on a lazy Sunday evening.I dont understand this much hate. If you don't like the lady, then don't watch it. Or at least judge the book by the contents and not just the cover. Trust me, there are way worse movies out there. Atlas is definitely okay to watch, even if Jlo is not your favorite.Now, to get back to the story. The opening is tense and well set up. You really feel the dread and tough spot society is in. CGI is good, the concept of a sentient house robot is totally feasible in a few years from now. The army's stupid decisions are text book.Just try this. You may be surprised."
"4","Plot Holes Galore","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9812535/?ref_=tt_urv","jayhayman","27 May 2024","I am generously giving this movie four stars, primarily for the visuals. They were the one positive about this movie. The plot has more holes than a wheel of Swiss cheese. It would take too much time to enumerate them all. In addition to gaping plot holes, the laws of physics are routinely ignored. Chemistry and biology were also largely disregarded. It is as if the writers of the screenplay slept through every science class they were ever required to attend. Nobody is asking Stephen Hawking levels of understanding, but at least get the basics. Hollywood writers are often woefully ignorant of what they are writing about, and when they are not, they expect that the viewers are."

I. Harlan (Simu Liu), and consequently a war where three-million humans are killed. In the end, Harlan flees to an unknown whereabouts in the outer space. When his right-arm Casca Decius (Abraham Popoola) is located on Earth and captured by the military forces, General Jake Boothe (Mark Strong) brings the analyst Atlas Shepherd (Jennifer Lopez) to interrogate Casca under the protest of Colonel Elias Banks (Sterling K. Brown). She succeeds to learn the planet where Harlan is and destroy Casca. She asks Gen. Boothe to go with Col. Banks in the mission of capturing Harlan's CPU since her mother, the scientist Val Shepherd (Lana Parrilla), created it and she was raised with Harlan. However, her distrust of A. I., her unstable behavior and the fact that she is not a Ranger make Col. Banks objects in principle, but he accepts her expertise later. When they arrive nearby the planet where Harlan is hidden, their spacecraft is attacked by Harlan's army and Atlas is forced to enter in an ARC to escape. However, she does not link with the A. I.

I.s. What will she do to try to save Earth?""Atlas"" is a Netflix movie with the story of a dystopian future after a war between humans and A. I.'s. There are good points, like the special effects and the view of the A. I.'s as evil or good like the mankind. Unfortunately, the histrionic performance of Jennifer Lopez is annoying and disappoints her fans. The director should have controlled her constant screams and overacting, despite her character be unstable and anti-social. The plot is satisfactory with a reasonable but with potential story with a rushed beginning as usual in Netflix's movies. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): ""Atlas"""
"1","Please change the title to Cry Baby!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9813169/?ref_=tt_urv","kvvijayshankar","28 May 2024","Jennifer Lopez isnt a good actor and this character has bought a new meaning to the word annoying!! She is relentless in her moaning, she crys and crys and crys to the end of the universe literally. If you want to hear a woman moaning and crying for 2 hours straight then please watch this and you wont be dissappointed. The movie is very poorly scripted with moments of usless drama and no logic scenes.I can stress enough on the moaning even when she is winning she is still moaning. She is not the correct lead for this movie and brad is never going to learn how to direct a good movie. Waste of time and resources!"
"7","Entertaining though","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9821642/?ref_=tt_urv","Obiigs","2 June 2024","ATLAS, starring the ever-dynamic Jennifer Lopez, is a thrilling ride from start to finish. The film's pacing is masterful, ensuring that there's never a dull moment. Lopez's performance is captivating, as she brings depth and emotion to a role that confines her within the mechanical bounds of a robot's cockpit. While some may find this setting limiting, it's a testament to her talent that she can command the screen and keep audiences engaged throughout the movie's runtime.However, this creative choice does come with its drawbacks. The majority of J. Lo's screen time is spent inside the robot's cockpit, which, while showcasing her acting prowess, gives the film an air of Goldorak nostalgia. This might not be what one expects from a big-budget Hollywood sci-fi movie, but it adds a unique charm to the film. It's a fresh take on the genre that blends the familiarity of classic mecha anime with the polish of modern cinema.In essence, ATLAS is an enjoyable experience that brings something new to the table. It's a film that's sure to entertain, and while it may not fit the traditional mold of its peers, it stands out for its ability to keep us thoroughly entertained without ever feeling repetitive or mundane."

I can't connect with the movie when her eyeshadow and lipstick are still there.Every movie she does, she wears too much makeup.And why all the crying and screaming?She is supposed to be the best.The best acting came from the Bot Smith. His lines were good.Honestly, the movie would have been a lot better, if they had recast the lead role. The other characters are good.She's good in romcoms. This movie was not for her. She does not have enough depth for serious acting.5/10 is generous."
"8","Jennifer Lopez was made to do action movies","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9826490/?ref_=tt_urv","escriba-51248","4 June 2024","I really liked this film. I usually find action movies dull, but this one is entertaining, I would almost say interesting. I usually find the rom-com style Jennifer Lopez movies utterly boring, but she's perfect for this role: raw, strong, passionate, grumpy, stubborn, big ego, coffee addict, and noone can curse like Jenny from the Bronx. She is so much more credible like this than as the nice pretty girl. Remember that this is the actress who gave such a candidly self- confident, ""the world is underestimating me"" kind of interview back in the nineties that it almost ruined her career. Except that it didn't, because she was right. Frankly, she should do more action movies from now on. And she makes this movie worth watching. She gives it the character, edge and, yes, emotion that most action movies lack. Most of this movie consists of Atlas talking to a machine, which is a challenging task for an actor. It is Lopez' great and authentic acting (apparently she had her husband saying Smith' lines) that lets this never get boring. Thoroughly enjoyable to watch."
"7","It's good despite general opinion","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9821591/?ref_=tt_urv","ktheveg","2 June 2024","I was quite happy with the overall movie. It told a good (if a bit predictable) story.With the rise of the new AI tools, it tells a story that could hit a bit close to home. The ""AI takes over the world"" trope is oversaturated, but since it was released during the time of AI being a very real thing, I think it's fine.The visuals are stunning. I absolutely loved the intricate details of each scene. I loved the work put into making everything look amazing. The only CGI that I really found off was the space background during the scene where Atlas was travelling to the planet, as it looked like a flat display.The acting was ok. I didn't mind Atlas' acting, but I'm not much of an acting reviewer, and it didn't break the story for me.The writing lended a bit to more telling than showing, but the humor was ok. I personally enjoy puns and wisecracks, so Smith's occasional quip felt ok.In terms of computer accuracy, however, lacked a bit, and that's where I find the most issue. Some people simplify parts of a computer by saying that 'The CPU is the brains of the computer'. That's not entirely accurate. The brain stores memories, but a CPU does not. The CPU is simply the thinking part of the brain. It has a comparitively tiny bit of memory, only enough to process the exact calculations it's working on at that exact time. The code would have most likely be put in the DRAM, which stores memory to use at any given time, but is somewhat quick to access, as well as a second copy in storage in case of a reboot.Should the AI be actually smart, and it would've destroyed the copy in storage, as DRAM can't store any memory when powered off (which means that effectively disconnecting it from power will delete all that precious 'code').Anyways, good movie, but with a few flaws (that I personally am ok with overlooking)"

It's a third rate Sci-fi project to serve up a paycheck for Jenny from the block. It will be adored by die hard JLO from the block fans who do not mind mediocre talent and will take what ever she offers. But for the rest of us it's best avoided.JLo is too self-aware when acting, just going through the motions saying her lines. She is JLo from the block play acting at being a data analyst who is saving the world and humanity (and to get the paycheck). And you cant take her seriously.If you have some sort of intelligence, and want to watch the film, watch the trailer instead. Its the whole story. It contains all the cliches, bad acting, and the predictability of the plot.JLO does better posing and being in photoshopped photes with filters rather than singing or acting.In all seriousness this money could have been given to fund other more worthy projects from talented independent studios featuring not so well known actors - who may have something unique to say.

Well, yeah, but I liked the fact that this was a more personal journey for someone who had made a mistake as a kid and was spending the rest of her life trying to correct it.Whether you appreciate AI good vs evil or not, this is the kind of movie that focuses on the decisions of a single character.

Just a few minutes cut from the movie would have made the movie 10 times better. Not that the movie was bad. Definitely not original but still very enjoyable for what it is. It's definitely pretty to watch most of the time but some of the action sequences suffer from too much happening at once and becoming garbled nonsense. Basically some of the heavy action scenes. You're going to hear this a great deal so let's just say it here as well, it's kinda the female to male version of the movie HER mixed with terminator. As much as I like Jennifer Lopez as an actor, she doesn't really sell the role she is cast in. Luckily a great deal of the scenes don't require a ton of emotional depth. She did a good enough job but this role probably would have been better with an actor that has better range. Let's sum up: needs better editing, needs a better leading lady, action scenes don't look particularly great. Fun movie despite its obvious defects."

Replace the Power Loader with the AMP suit from Avatar, mix in the sync' element from Pacific Rim with Cortana from Halo, a hostile environment where team work helps like After Earth and a whole bunch of AI tropes from movies involving AI uprising such as Terminator, The Creator, Blade Runner etc.. etc.Throw it all in the algorithm mixer and ChatGP delivers the screenplay for 'Atlas'.

debate watching.The acting and special effects are pretty good. Even the AI voice comes across as human, while the human actors do their part; the acting is nicely intimate and you develop feelings for all of the characters. These are people who you would have no problem inviting over for a barbecue.While there are some glitches with the special effects, they do pretty well. While they aren't awe-inspiring, they are well above what you would expect in this kind of movie. There are times that your forget that it's CGI and the times it is obviously CGI you honestly don't mind.However....don't think too hard about the plot and the think-piece parts are laid on a bit too thick. The human/AI ""must work together"" theme is ham-fisted, and there are huge holes in the plot once you apply any sort of thought to it. Even some of the ways to create suspense are questionable.So while the acting is top-notch and the effects are nicely done, someone seriously needed to look at the plot a bit harder."

The plot is painfully slow, lacking any compelling twists or engaging moments. The dialogue is insipid, and the supporting cast does nothing to elevate the experience.

It was just a way to spend time with your partner after a long day of work. Was the movie flawless? No! The plot was a mixture of many Sci fi films we have seen. Even feels a bit of Fallout with the robot and all. JLO was the movie. I mean the movie is named Atlas which is her character name. She isn't an method or Oscar grade actress but Jlo have given us plenty of movie to like her in. This movie was no exception. I think audiences shdnt give her a hard time. She is doing what she loves. That is acting. She does she look good for her age."

J lo isn't an actress, she's a singer. Period.I had to fast forward it so I wouldn't doze off ..
I'm so sick and tired of Netflix giving us all this trash movies over and over again. Don't we pay enough already to expect better movies?Not sure who felt the Skript was good showing is 2 hours of whining J lo and her over trembling lip. It was so hard to watch that.I only give it 4 stars because I liked the special effects."
"6","Star Trek + Marvel...missing Star Wars","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9810347/?ref_=tt_urv","rlsmith1994","26 May 2024","The film went for Star Trek + Marvel. It could've used a little more Star Wars.To me, the most impressive and entertaining aspect of the film was the interplay between J Lo and Smith, her AI companion. It kind of reminded me of the dynamic between the emotional Captain Kirk and rationale, but understanding and reasonable, Spock. If not for this element, I would have rated this film a 5 or even 4.The story has an interesting premise, albeit one already explored. So, it includes a backstory that unfortunately falls a little flat.The best movies have interesting bad guys. Star Wars excelled at this; maybe the best. The film could've developed some interesting bad guys to complete the story. But they're analytical and boring. The film could've used a boba fett/western man in black type character. There was a whole world to explore on the alien planet, but we barely saw it. Fortunately, J Lo did a great job playing off Smith, saving the film from disaster.Atlas is worth a watch for sci fi fans. But it's not a movie you'll likely rewatch."
"6","It's a 5.5 a best but a 6 is fair as it's AI themed with a +ve outcome","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9813089/?ref_=tt_urv","keeping-it-simple","28 May 2024","**Movie Review: Atlas****Rating: 5.5/10**""Atlas"" brings Jennifer Lopez into the sci-fi spotlight as Atlas Shepherd, a brilliant yet misanthropic data analyst on a mission to capture a rogue robot. With her inherent distrust of artificial intelligence, Atlas's journey is one of personal growth and reluctant alliances. While the movie has its moments of entertainment and fun, it falls short of fully delivering on its ambitious premise.From the onset, JLo's portrayal of Atlas Shepherd is uneven. Early scenes, such as her morning routine while watching TV news reports, feel somewhat forced and lack the authenticity needed to draw viewers into her character's world. This inconsistency extends to her emotional peaks, particularly in the climactic scenes where her pain and tears don't quite resonate as intended.However, despite these shortcomings, ""Atlas"" manages to engage. I initially considered skipping it, but a surprising turn of events around the 31-minute mark hooked me. From this point, the movie finds a better rhythm and delivers an entertaining narrative that keeps the audience invested.The film introduces some intriguing concepts, particularly regarding the future of AI and the ethical dilemmas it presents. Yet, it misses an opportunity to delve deeper into these themes. A more substantial focus on the godfather of AI and his safety protocols could have added a layer of depth and realism, making the stakes feel more tangible.Visually, ""Atlas"" is a mixed bag. The CGI is impressive in certain scenes, enhancing the futuristic setting and action sequences. Nevertheless, there are noticeable moments where the CGI's integration falters, and the backdrop appears artificial, slightly detracting from the immersion.Overall, ""Atlas"" is a decent movie with compelling ideas and some genuinely fun sequences. It's worth a watch if you're a fan of sci-fi and Jennifer Lopez, but it doesn't quite hit the mark as a must-see. The potential is there, but a few more convincing performances and a tighter narrative focus could have elevated it to something special.By the way in theme with the movie and full disclosure I used ChatGPT to help write this review."

Like what am I supposed to take away from this movie? It served no point at all.It will easily be forgotten.They should have had J. Lo on her feet, battling Harlan for most of the movie since he is super strong, it would have been hard for her to survive battles with him, so that would have made it more edge of your seat.They could have explained more about the robots turning on humans rather than just focusing on two of them.However, Jennifer Lopez did a great job acting. I was impressed by that. But otherwise, a completely forgettable movie.But if you don't have anything else to watch, it's alright. But don't expect it to make you think afterwards.

The film's resemblance to ""Titanfall"" suggests a significant influence, which enhances its appeal. The story, while familiar, is engaging enough to keep viewers interested. If you're a fan of action-packed sci-fi movies like ""Moonfall,"" ""Titanfall,"" ""Transformers,"" or ""Heart of Stone,"" ""ATLAS"" is definitely worth watching.

"6","Atlas: A Futuristic Tale Hampered by Implausibility and Inconsistency","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9809775/?ref_=tt_urv","peterbutseraen","26 May 2024","""Atlas"" attempts to offer an exciting and futuristic look at the symbiosis between humans and machines, but despite a few highlights, the film falls short due to a lack of credibility and inconsistencies in execution.In this film, Jennifer Lopez plays the role of Atlas, a woman with exceptional analytical thinking skills. Although this sounds intriguing, the film quickly raises questions about the plausibility of this premise. In a world where even today's AI systems are already much better at analytical thinking than humans, it feels unlikely that Atlas would add any value to a symbiosis with Smith, a state-of-the-art AI system.The dialogues, probably not written by AI given their lack of sophistication, contribute to this feeling of implausibility. In a film centered on the advanced capabilities of artificial intelligence, one would expect the thought exercises behind the story and characters to have more depth. Unfortunately, this is not the case, making many conversations feel forced and unrealistic.Jennifer Lopez does not shine in this role, and it seems that the film would have been better with a different actor or actress. The excessive focus on her character makes the story one-dimensional and less engaging. The film would have benefited from introducing multiple storylines, which could have added more dynamism and depth.The proposed neurolink symbiosis between Atlas and Smith is an interesting concept but is not well developed. The idea that the analytical skills of a human would add something to an AI system in the future feels illogical. The gap between human and AI capabilities is expected to only grow larger, making this symbiosis redundant.One of the film's positive points is its visual effects. These are impressive and contribute to the futuristic atmosphere of the film. However, there is a clear gap between these visual effects and the scenes shot in the studio, creating an inconsistent visual experience. The contrasts are so significant that they break the viewer's immersion.While the film has potential with its visual splendor and exploration of human-AI interactions, this potential is not fully realized due to a lack of depth and logical coherence in the script. ""Atlas"" could have been an intriguing exploration of the future, but it gets stuck in unrealistic premises and mediocre dialogues.**Conclusion:** ""Atlas"" offers an interesting but implausible view of the future of humans and AI. The film lacks the finesse and logic needed to truly convince, and the inconsistency between visual effects and studio shots exacerbates this issue. Despite the impressive visuals and intriguing concept, the film is hindered by too much focus on one character and a lack of additional storylines. As a result, the film leaves the viewer with more questions than answers. It's a shame."
"5","What writes this stuff - an AI?","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9806809/?ref_=tt_urv","verminhater","24 May 2024","Could easily be a B movie but reasonable (not good, just reasonable) cgi hauls this dirge up to bang average. That the cgi is the best thing about this is is pretty damning of everything else. The story is hackneyed and predictable and the acting is not going to impress any drama coach. It appears the writer is at least a fan of sci-fi as there's a lot of other movies mixed in here. The ranger briefing is straight out of Aliens, the basic plot from I-Robot and some of the music from terminator. The casting of Lopez is an enigma as she has always struggled with the task yet here she plays someone who struggles with people so perhaps like Arnie playing an emotionless terminator she has found a niche in playing an emotionless human.What we have here is a film made to an algorithmic formula that will add nothing to your brain but will take a couple of hours from it. I'd not be surprised if an AI wasn't instrumental in cobbling this together and if it wasn't then those who were responsible would do well to claim it was and let it take the blame. Let this be a lesson that actual talent is needed to make a good film, not just letting someone program a large language AI to study several previous sci-fi films and regurgitate them with a shiny new suit on."
"7","Does exactly what's written on the label...","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9827294/?ref_=tt_urv","frizzardi","5 June 2024","...and this is quite refreshing, compared to the current offerings.Let me explain: I watched True Detective 4 expecting a detective story and got a soap opera instead. Watched The Marvels and got a musical number. Watched Rogue Moon and got an inchoate mess instead of a story. Watched The Creator (a movie that shares the basic premise of Atlas) and got a warmed-up soup.Somebody is apparently trying to re-invent storytelling to ""modernize"" it, and is failing miserably.Atlas on the other hand has a simple story, it's developed with craft (if not with art) to its logical end, it has no glaring plot holes and doesn't slap you in the face with CGI: the special effects are there, but add flavour to the story instead of replacing it.Acting is adequate; some dialogues may feel forced but most of them aren't; the director is competent.To summarize, Atlas would have been an average movie ten or twenty years ago; nowadays it stands a head above the rest - mostly because average movie quality has fallen quite low.Special mentions to JLo who manages to carry the movie and to convey some emotions from time to time; her character feels realistic enough and doesn't do stupid things just for the sake of the plot.Simu Liu is creepy enough as the unstoppable villain; his motivations are refreshingly different from the usual desire to conquer the world - he just has a goal he deems worthy and is determined to achieve it at any cost.The explosion of the ship near the end of the movie is amazing! The CGI crew somehow managed to inject some novelty into something as mundane as a Hollywood explosion. I'll have to re-watch that scene."

I'm not sure what they were thinking when they made this movie, but clearly they should have done the end of the movie through out the whole movie half the plot doesn't make sense, its poorly written almost as if AI wrote the movie script which would be incredibly ironic, you spend two hours watching this wishing you had watched something else instead, I am incredibly annoyed after wasting two hours of my life watching this."

Characters were not very well written. A bit of a waste of Simu Lu and Sterling K. Brown's talent. Mark Strong was the same as every other thing he's been in, minus the British-ness. Good special effects and stunning visuals. Had promise, but was ultimately disappointing. Predictable. JLo managed to stay sexy with perfect makeup even though she was thrashed around, got about 5 concussions and CTE, almost died about 10 times, broke some bones and got slashed with super futuristic space weapons. The future in this movie sure has some magical healing - at the end she looks like she just came back from a spa retreat. üòÇ"

Initially, the depiction of AI by Jennifer Lopez's character (whose talent I acknowledge) seemed somewhat naive, as science fiction writers have explored the subject in much greater depth. However, I had to stop watching the movie after an hour due to the constant screaming, which I found unbearable (despite recognizing Lopez's talent). Additionally, the CGI and set design were not impressive in my opinion. The silver lining is that I watched it on Netflix, so I didn't have to pay for a ticket. Although it's currently number one on the platform in France, I can only give it four stars, considering the budget spent."

You'd think with the level if technology they show that things would have been different. At least I'd have done things differently in command. I do really hope this gets a sequel be it another film or a series as there's a lot of big budget ones now and it would be nice to see this world go further perhaps exploring this planet and others a bit more."

It felt like a rehash of countless other action films, just with different faces.To sum up the chaotic mess this movie presents: crucial military decisions are made based on a character's emotional whims, which is hardly convincing or practical.This movie had potential but faltered in execution. It heavily relies on the lead actor to carry the story, and unfortunately, Jennifer Lopez doesn't quite fit the bill. Her performance is one-dimensional; whether she's cracking jokes or facing intense fear and sorrow, she maintains the same expression.Another actor with a knack for nuanced performances would have been a better choice for this role. ""Atlas"" ultimately feels like a missed opportunity, bogged down by superficial execution and uninspired acting. Seriously, don't waste your time like I did."

Looking past this, the story line isn't too bad, nothing we haven't seen before but enough to make it enjoyable. You'll also play spot the typical cliche sections from other other popular sci-fi films such as the meeting in the hanger and a major talk down from J-Lo which might be a little similar to Alien maybe, even the mech robots are similar. The final verdict, I didn't switch it of half way through so it turned out to be a half decent film and even my wife enjoyed it so can't be too bad."

They put a sci fi garb on a badly written non-scifi script. Scenes are long and drawn out. The protagonist eats up 3 to 4 minutes every time she has to make a decision, by going into an emotional tirade. I don't recommend this movie, it is a waste of time. I don't know who keeps telling J-Lo she can act. I read one review which referred to J-Lo as eye candy. J-Lo is not eye candy, she is an old grandma. In this day and age, when people don't have time to waste, Netflix keeps shooting smelly turds like this one. Why Netflix? How are you folks not bankrupt? This entire film is a spoiler."

However Jennifer is just terrible in this movie. She is constantly crying and just overall terrible acting. She is trying to project this strong woman look but it just falls flat as you can see the acting is just forced. The rest of the crew seems to support her role all along through the movie. I think the movie is great to watch but just be ready for a lot of annoying ""I don't want to, I can't wa wa wa"" coming from her. I think other reviews here point this out as well. Terrible actor selection for this movie."

To hell with character development, story lines that make sense, and being the slightest bit innovative. I found myself not giving a damn about any of the characters and even less about the plot line...that didn't seem to be very deep. For someone that seemed to have such a hatred and distrust of AI, Atlas sure did have quite a bit of it surrounding herself in daily life. You'd expect someone like that to be totally closed off and isolated from it. But, no. She waltzes right into what appears to be a very high level cyber security branch of a future military. Huh??Not good."

The film's exploration of moral dilemmas and human resilience adds depth to the storyline.However, the pacing of the movie feels uneven, with certain scenes dragging on while others lack sufficient development. The character arcs, although promising, fall short of leaving a lasting impact. The dialogue at times feels forced and fails to fully engage the viewer.Despite its flaws, ""Atlas"" manages to deliver moments of suspense and thought-provoking themes. With tighter editing and more nuanced character development, this film could have reached greater heights. Overall, ""Atlas"" is a decent watch for fans of dystopian sci-fi, but it falls short of realizing its full potential."

I suppose Jennifer Lopez must be a good actress because I despised her for the entire movie. For a supposed smart person she's one of the most stupid people in the movie. She constantly strives to sabotage every single aspect of her life and what she knows she must do and is important not just for herself but basically for all of humanity. Even the premise is ridiculous, and does not make logical sense. Actions are performed in this movie which are pointless and do not make sense. For instance almost none of this story had to occur in the first place."

JLo isn't good in this. It's not that she's a terrible actress, but she's not a great one either and having so much focus on just her in a mech suit makes for a difficult watch. It would be like watching Buried but instead of Ryan Reynolds they cast. Luke Wilson's character from Idiocracy.Now we've got that covered.... Take a large cup full of I-Robot, a cup of Aliens, a spoonful of Blade Runner and a generous heaped teaspoon of Pacific Rim. Throw them in a blender, pour into a medium Edge of Tomorrow shaped dish, and bake in an Flight of the Navigator themed oven at 180, for too long. You get the idea.There's nothing wrong with borrowing from other movies, but almost every scene in this felt like a poor rip off of something better without bringing anything unique or interesting to it. Worse, it fell fowl of every sci-fi cliche in the book. From the zoom and enhance (actually zoom into back of head, artificially rotate and ""rebuild"", and wow, that's our guy) to the ""I've been expecting you"" despite there being zero chance of said person being there if not for the plot saying so.People have been praising the effects, but i don't see it. The AI characters look like a video game and the fight scenes are the off cuts even Michael Bay refused to use in the first transformers movie.Basically, I'd give it a miss, unless you want to laugh at how ridiculous it is."

It's a decent choice for a ""free"" streaming sci-fi movie, but that's about it.Jennifer Lopez's performance in this film is lackluster. Her character spends most of the time crying, wailing, moaning, and screaming. The acting and story both fall flat, turning what could have been a good movie into just another forgettable film.I'm personally tired of seeing Simon Liu, and his performance here doesn't help. The story had potential but was ruined by poor direction and cheesy acting. I wouldn't recommend wasting two hours of your life on this movie.While Atlas might be a little entertaining at times, it's far from being a sci-fi classic. The effort is there, but it just doesn't hit the mark."

It ends up feeling like a B-movie with a Mid blockbuster budget, tossing together tropes from other films like a cinematic smoothie.But hey, if you need something playing in the background while you doomscroll, it's got JLo, and she's always a pleasure to watch.This movie makes Rebel Moon look like The Godfather.

This role she just appeared to overact a bit. She just couldn't sell being an analyst (programmer) and then turning into this robo fighter. She tried to be very emotional is some scenes but it did not work. The dialogue between her and the robot voice was somewhat humorous. The special effects were pretty good otherwise this movie would have gotten a 1 star. The plot was very weak. I did fall asleep halfway thru the movie and rewatched the second half the next day. JLo actually got paid $10M for her role. That seems a bit excessive for a non-movie star. She is in her mid 50s and I thought the role would have suited someone much younger."

She cried when she crashed landed, she cried when she got frustrated, she cried when she was scared, she cried when she talked about herself, ....... so annoying when an emotionally fragile human cries at anything because it's all about her. Unlike Ripley who was a great admirable female lead in alien movies, Atlas is just an annoyingly emotional person always on the verge of crying. The story line is basic and many scenes are stolen from other movies including terminator, transformers, pacific rim, Star Wars, edge of tomorrow....... Pretty lazy production. The only positive about this movie was the cgi which is why 2 stars instead of 0."

Though there's aspects of predictability this is not your typical story line.Is it a movie I would recommend yes, I think It's a pretty good sci-fi movie. Now that the progression of AI is more real in our time, though it's a movie it's not far off from what our world could be like in future and the dangers of it."

Dialogue is cheesy and often reflective of JLOs real feelings for her personal life and her husband üòâ soundtrack is okay and nothing to go back and listen too.

Now this movie Atlas is a joke, her half whisper ""pity me"" lines give her no credibility at all. I didn't take the time to see who directed this, but not only is the attitude wrong but her timing is way off.I can't count how often in a drama scene her fake emotion brought me to full laughter. Cringeable, I can't believe this made it through post production. The special effects were corny, the exploding head with the popping eyeball comes to mind. I couldn't continue watching, obviously the director was distracted. The camera work was very professional and the sound was perfect. All production was great the feature character casting is very poor. Some of the same failed character combinations she has carried with her in other movies.I just wasn't expecting a parody, I thought it was a serious movie but it was not. Dramatic lines were coupled with faceless expression. What's with the pity soft voice. A joke in my opinion. Sorry Jennifer.I'm waiting to see what others think but it's all thumbs down for meüëé"
"1","IDK, Just ok","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9812177/?ref_=tt_urv","sonju-86318","27 May 2024","I kind of wonder who produced the movie because I'm trying to understand why Jennifer Lopez was the best actress for this role. The A. I voice of Smith was a better actor. Lopez, made the movie funny in a non funny way. Lopez did try to act though; too hard in some parts and didn't show real emotion in others. Just wish the other actors had more of a presence, would have made the movie less annoying. Just can't get over her no cry crying and the noises she makes in the ""action"" scenes. I love a good sci-fi movie but this had b-movie vibes with some really good actors in it. If you watch it, have no or really low expectations."
"4","What a dumpster fire","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9813382/?ref_=tt_urv","siderite","28 May 2024","This is like a direct mix of Shang-Chi and the Humans series. Someone blended them together and then just threw that onto an empty canvas and called it modern art. The good parts in those shows missed the canvas completely. The result is bad in almost every aspect: the story, the details, the characters, their names, the acting, the logic. AIs would have never written this script because they have their dignity.To understand how badly this film misses the mark, it starts with a woman - named Atlas by her own mother - who plays chess with a computer in the future. The computer checks her, so she makes a magical move that checkmates the computer, then the computer displays that she has won 71 times in a row. If this doesn't scream: run away! I don't know what will. And it gets worse from there.I have no idea who comes up with these things, then convinces other people to give them money for them. They must be checkmating from a check position chess geniuses, because in every other industry if you come with a stupid idea, people throw you out into the street.Bottom line: regardless of your personal feelings towards J-Lo, AI, movie making or truth and reality, this film is simply very boring. It's entertainment value can only be perceived while truly inebriated and perhaps not even then. Here's to Planty the plant!"

I must admit that I was szeptu al about the project, but still set a reminder on Netflix. It is an interesting story, with some interesting scenes. The thing I enjoyed the most was the relationship between Atlas and Smith. They had some hilarious moments. There is enough hate in the world so why don't you just make some popcorn, have a drink and enjoy the ride, you won't regret it. You may be disappointed that it is not a cinema like production, but in the era of Disney garbage you get something that is great for a Friday night. Enjoy. (and, I still don't know her)"

The whole movie is Jennifer Lopez in a box on a greenscreen. And unfortunately she is not a strong enough actor to carry a whole movie by herself.So the movie starts on a woman with crazy hair, This was the very first thing that I noticed. I thought she was going to be a robot because she wakes up with this crazy hair, has the same crazy hair in every picture of her and goes to work and comes home with the same crazed hair.And so She is not a robot, or ai. Thats not the twist. The twist is that there is no twist. Literally. I think. It seems like the twist was that Atlas thought she was responsible somehow. And clearly she is not.. But i dont get it. I guess the twist is that the name Atlas doesnt mean anything important.So instead of letting the ai leave they chase him down in another freaking galaxy...Woa woah hold on. Another galaxy? So humanity is spread throughout the universe now? Who knows. Its never mentioned. Not a single freaking time. The humans speak as if earth is the only planet humans are on. Which makes zero sense."
"5","Cliche movie but JLo, really?","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9824618/?ref_=tt_urv","eattwocookies","3 June 2024","Just like any other action packed/scifi, now AI movie, this could've been better but with JLo being the main actress, it was not going to be the best movie. She cannot act, it's amateur-ish and you can tell she's trying hard. If you want the movie to do well, start with choosing better actors.The action itself (CGI) was great. Please, just stop putting JLo in the actor's seat, she's not meant for it. She can stick to singing. Most of these singers can adapt to movies but not her. Her acting is bland.Maybe add a twist to these kind of movies for the future because they're becoming repetitive at this point."
"5","Average flick; not as bad as many critics say","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9823379/?ref_=tt_urv","redban02","2 June 2024","It's not nearly as bad as the critics say. J'Lo really wasn't bad for the role. Her character was a nerdy analyst, not a Michelle Rodriguez type of action hero. I thought the dialogue/monologue between her and Smith (the AI) was kind of charming at timesI do feel the movie becomes too video game-ish, the runtime was about 20 mins too long, the villain didn't seem as scary as he should've, and i didn't like how they recycled that one black gentleman as the henchman. They missed big chances to show some gorgeous visuals of an alien planet in other galaxy.But overall, the film isn't a terrible watch."

Uneventful. I had more fun matching a shopping bag full of socks.Why do the studios find this garbage? The only good thing was that I could watch it at home, pause it, come back hoping it could get better. But then 7 minutes in after my break I had to walk away. The cinematography was decent but the story was truly flat. That actress was a bore. She didn't deliver anything that didn't make me not fast forward her parts. Yawn.Hard pass if your thinking about watching this 'movie?'. It's not worth your time unless of course you have to fold laundry."
"8","Action Sci-Fi","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9810474/?ref_=tt_urv","amiles-48091","26 May 2024","There seems to be a trend recently if you don't get deep and meaning character development in a film then it is rubbish. To be honest I can't be bothered hours of back story on character development and a thumbs up Altas concentrating on action rather than deep philosophical themes or preachy statements. Anyone who knows Mechs will know the Atlas has a certain place within mech history and I'm assuming this is where the film gets its title. This Mech is mainly made for combat so this film is a action sci-fi film at heart. Yes, there are bits about AI which is not that original but i dont believe the writer or director are bothered about what you think in the real world about the pros or cons of AI. The human story is a little predictable so i can't give this an oustanding. Visuals and performances are fine and well worth a brain non-engagement film evening at home."
"4","Could Have Been Better","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9807269/?ref_=tt_urv","darad","25 May 2024","From the previews alone, I thought this would be an exceptional science fiction movie, showcasing impressive CGI effects and an action-packed storyline. Unfortunately, it fell short due to a weak plot and poor acting. It took only 15 minutes to realize that this film would be a disappointment. Adding to the frustration, I watched this immediately after seeing ""Madam Web,"" a recent box office flop, which now seems better in comparison. Despite the promising visuals and initial excitement, the film ultimately failed to deliver a compelling or enjoyable experience. This was a letdown, especially considering the high expectations set by its marketing. Overall, it was a frustrating watch that underscored the importance of a strong story and good acting in making a movie truly engaging."

And that is the smallest leap of faith you will need to take in this movie. It's actually entertaining in a cheap way. But it is also a good example of illiterate folks trying to write a science / tech story. Super intelligent AI is portrayed as angry hackers/ FSP. Army rangers in AI mech suits are as disposable a they are useless. And in the end is just a drama about accepting losses and treachery from someone you trusted.So in order to enjoy the film, through away any notion of common sense you have and just accepted as a Sunday SciFi TV movie for your mom & dad. That's it. Ah! And good CGI."
"4","boy howdy was that bad writing","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9813718/?ref_=tt_urv","matrice444","28 May 2024","I don't often leave comments but I feel compelled. Everything was so very contrived, but the dialogs just hurt. The visual effects were perhaps the only redeeming quality.I gave it a try because of the cast however I don't believe this to be a feather in the cap of any of them. I don't blame them, they had to deal with such a poorly written script... and OMG JL did almost nothing but cry and scream... GROW THE F..K UP. Her character should have been wearing diapers.There are a few of the classic Hollywood ""feel good"" moments, but everything is so very predictable that nothing surprises.I guess this movie is good for anybody under 12 years old that doesn't yet have any grasp on reality, or the average American of any age... a nation without a grasp on reality."
"1","Recipe for zombie audience","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9818686/?ref_=tt_urv","web-534-393830","31 May 2024","A movie following the prefect recipe for a zombie audience: woman that is perfect from beginning to end, without flaws, always well intended and better than all computational artificial intellect in the world combined, of course. World that ""has to become united"" to confront a global enemy, of course. Let's make the casting as diverse as possible, of course. Use a lot of cheap CHI instead of investing the budget in a better plot and screenplay, because special effects with no depth is what really matters, of course. The result: children will be happily indoctrinated having a donut. Fortunately they didn't keep some extra money to fake positive ratings, so the only legit thing about Atlas is its 5.6. No need of artificial intelligence to understand that."

Is it Minority Report? Is it Interstellar?No! No! & NO! Yet I definitely don't mind at all!I'm not crazy about JLO, but it was I would say one of the best movies I've seen her in.The whole movie caries a pleasant vibe and actually I felt like wanting to see more of it in the end. The connection between the main characters was portrayed nicely and switching between action and comedy moments was just nice to watch.For the most part the CGI was very good except a few minor things I noticed, that's just me and i'd say a professional deformation.Overall I have enjoyed the movie far more than Rebel Moon 2.For me it is 7/10 or 8/10 ... I'm giving it 8, because it doesn't deserve such harsh criticism you can read here.Watch it and enjoy!"
"1","So cheap","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9812848/?ref_=tt_urv","kazemsharkas-16783","28 May 2024","The movie was done very cheaply,Jennifer Lopez was by herself most of the film,
What a cheap production and very lame story,
If we calculated the amount of time Lopez was on the screen by herself we would find that she was almost 70% of the time on the screen talking to a computer voice .Maybe because she was the producer so she made sure that she appears more than anybody else .For me,I don't recommend the movie at all and I would like Miss Lopez next movie to give a chance for others to act and to play a role please .I hope we don't see part two of this movie because we got tired of seeing one actor all the movie ."
"4","Things Go Boom In Hollow Space Movie.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9822035/?ref_=tt_urv","crankyz-439-857068","2 June 2024","Everybody gets in a mood where they just want to watch a movie where things explode. This is it. This is the movie for people with short attention spans. Jennifer is very pretty to look at but her character whines the whole way so I wanted to spend less time with her. Every frame is filled with stuff to look at and the cuts come quick in some sequences. The CGI is impressive but it still doesn't make for a good movie. It's a feast visually and thought and production are on the screen, it just suffers from the more and faster syndrome which doesn't necessarily mean a better movie. You literally can't take anything in because it's moving ALL THE TIME. Adolescents and teenagers would probably like it but it is a pass from me."
"5","Waste of good effects","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9821311/?ref_=tt_urv","efd-10467","2 June 2024","Modern effects can open up fantastic sci fi worlds and this movie offers up some good effects and a reasonable sci fi movie.What drags it down is Jennifer Lopez, she over acts and generally is so bad she makes the movie boring. Firstly her need to have 'big' hair overrides all common sense, she just looks silly. Next is her inability to convey feeling without grossly over doing it, she seems continuously either in or near a complete meltdown, it is too much too often, you start to really dislike her.Unless she helped fund this movie she does nothing for it, while I suspect the director thought her name would draw eyes to his show, it may but once they are there, her performance destroys everything else.The director or writer or both, are heavily influenced by Aliens and Blade Runner, but it ends up a poor attempt to be serious sci fi. So it has good effects and action with a clean, fast moving modern look, but poor casting takes all the gloss off."
"10","Great movie","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9808919/?ref_=tt_urv","zekyvicky","26 May 2024","I know a lot of people probably will snort at this because it is a J. Lo movie. But I loved it! It had my attention, and that of my husband who usually does not watch JLo movies. The story about finding ourselves, forgiveness and redemption. Great CGI, and the story did not pretend to be what it was not.. if you are looking for a true sci-fi movie, this is not it. This is about pain, guilt and finding yourself.The actors did a great job, cinematography and sound were a voice average , and the emotional component was the best. I highly recommend!Don't let the bad reviews keep you away, I enjoyed it. Give it a chance."
"5","Good story, really bad acting!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9820829/?ref_=tt_urv","bullmasters","1 June 2024","Too much overacting, Jeniffer Lopez has never been a good actress, she is, in every film, either unwilling or incapable of not appearing flawless and she is absolutely unbelivable in this movie, her whining and crying feels fake, besides she's supposed to be in her thirties in the movie? What a joke, who would believe that when she's going 60 soon! The story is actually good, it had potential, it actually reminds me of a nice video game called Titan Fall. They should have picked someone younger. Overall it was entertaining but I think it was a missed opportunity, it could have been a great movie."
"2","By all means, AVOID","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9820236/?ref_=tt_urv","paul-allaer","1 June 2024","As ""Atlas"" (2024 release; 120 minutes) opens, we are in the near future and AI has gone rogue. The AI model at issue was built by Shepherd Robotics, and a 10 yo girl called Atlas grew up along. We then go to ""28 Years Later"", and Atlas, now 38, is an AI terrorist expert... At this point we are 10 minutes into the movie.Couple of comments: this is the latest from director Brad Peyton (""Rampage""). More importantly, this is also the latest from Jennifer Lopez who stars as Atlas but also co-produced. JLo tries her best with the material she is given, which alas is not much. The script is beyond bad, and that sinks the movie then and there. Let me be upfront: I gave this movie a try, and I lasted about 40 minutes, at which point I simply gave up and bailed. You don't have to waste 40 minutes of your life, I already did it for you!""Atlas"" started streaming on Netflix over the Memorial Day weekend. It is currently rated a dismal 19% Certified Fresh on Rotten Tomatoes, and for good reason. I simply cannot recommend this to anyone in good conscience. By all means, AVOID."

Also her teeth and gums seem to be A-Okay. She co-produced this joke of a movie. It reeks of narcissism. Her act is entirely unbelievable to the point of being plainly annoying. What an utter waste of resources.I admit, for almost 55 she looks great. But I really do not care. At some point she will have to face the fact that she is mortal. I wonder how much modern technology went into rejuvenation, be it physically or via CGI.I care about story telling. Without it, everything else is wasted. Why are 80% of movies produced lacking this simple requirement? It probably takes more effort to write a decent script than to direct and produce it."

Maybe even a little on the cheap side. But that is not what this movie was about. After watching the trailer for this movie I though I knew exactly how this was gonna play out but I was wrong in a good way.This movie is about connection and how it makes you feel. At first the AI assistant or robot we are introduced to is very stoic and distant but as the movie progresses we start to learn more about his personality or he about the protagonists but that is a good thing.Sure the cliffhanger was very predictable but even amongst the bad CGI this movie made me feel something and for that it deserves some praise.Anyone bashing on Jennifer Lopez acting really needs to re-evaluate their standards."

But clearly Jennifer was told from a very young age that she was pretty and talented and she could do what ever she wanted. Now we have Atlas to prove that she is in fact pretty. She is not a good actress In this movie.Now if we talk about the Cell thats a different matter... but that was a stunning movie, visually at least, I may have to go watch that now to wash Atlas from my eyeballs and long term memory.Her overacting is absolutely shocking. She has no shades of grey, she is either on or off. And in this movie she is ON! Now I am a lady who likes to big up fellow women, but lets call a spade a spade. This is a shocker."

The poor acting from the lead made it difficult to sit through, with over-emotional, forced scenes and predictable signalling. I'm giving this movie 4 stars based on the strong concept, the well-done action scenes and the somewhat good performances by some of the supporting actors.However, the film misses the mark in terms of what most of the public likely seeks in an AI movie. Something clever, entertaining and thought-provoking. Unless the intention was to appeal to a less discerning audience, in which case, they succeeded."

I don't care about the reviews, I actually enjoyed watching it. JLo isn't one of my favorite actresses but she's quite decent in Atlas. Did not feel like scrolling through my phone while watching it or roll my eyes at her acting. I liked how much it was about trust and making a connection with another, even if not a human being. Don't know why people are giving her such a hard time about making movies, they usually have a good message to send, especially this one. Anyway, as i said in the beginning, it was more than I expected and I gave it 10 stars just for that."

I skipped 90 percent of the scenes with the main lead actress in it. She was literally unbearable to watch, which in turn made the movie unbearable to watch whenever she was on screen. I finished this movie in less than an hour by skipping mostly everything except the interesting visuals, and she still managed to get on my nerves. If she was the only problem with this movie it would receive a 3 out of 10, but the denseness of certain characters made the entire plot hard to believe. For example, sending a ship with warheads aboard before even doing basic reconnaissance."

that if the writers would run this script though ChatGPT or another ai generator
that could have come up with a much better script then what on earth this was.Actress JayLo plays.. actress jay lo in every movie she is in .I wouldnt say she cant act but her acting ability is not that good.She is a far better singer then she is an actor.Honestly the voice over for Smith the AI was far better then her preformance and he carry's the movie
and is a far better charechter and actor as jayloin a movie where more then half of the movie is jaylo and smith you really need a good main to carry that.Unfortunetly Jaylo not only that is not a good actress
also her charechter is so annoying .A data analyst AI Expert that hates AI (so why did she became an AI analysit ?)
she is amazing at chess beating her AI 72 games
but horrible at prodicting every obvios move along her way.I fast forwarded 1/3 of this movie
and this would have been painful to see on the cinema without fast forwarding.Its a cute weekend watch
obviosly good when there are no better options on netflix
but its not a memoriable movie
i will forget about it in 1 week."

Acting - nothing much. Rather no acting in the movie.1 - Very first scene about AI depicted alright but could have been improvised.2 - JLO started crying and crying till the end
3 - predictable behaviour by the main character itself
4 - If someone is willing to go for a fight should be ready for all the protocols and responsibilities to care about the people
5 - she was combat ready without any psychological evaluation just because she insisted
6 - her acting was actually below par. Normally she is a fine actor but director somehow made her to cry through out the movie

So may emotions that she's apparently never felt in real life. It's like watching her in a shrinks office for most of the movie. The secondary characters are pretty good but the vast majority of the screentime is her alone, doing really stupid stuff until....yep, she finally gets it and you know the rest. I won't spoil it but she will.If you are one of the 4 people who love JLO, give it a shot. Otherwise take a shot every time she overacts, and you'll be too drunk to care.Who wanted her for this movie? Every scene she is going off. She's supposed to be a high level anylyst but she acts like she's never heard of stress, yet alone been under stress.Really sad effort here, embarrassing for anyone involved...A generous 3 from me for everything not JLO in this movie."

Seriously... this film was predictable, cheesy, badly acted with some cringe inducing dialogue and truly eye rolling moments. I have no issue with cheesy action sci-fi flicks. Got quite a few in my collection. But this bland and horribly miscast mess was an absolute chore. The nicest thing I can think of to say about the film is that some of the CG is fun.

Speeding through all the trite dialog helped reduce the movie to about 20 minutes, and even that was intolerable.I gather JLO believes we will find her sexy in her declining years. Looking disheveled and worn down is not sexy. She clearly focused on herself as the protagonist, and the movie focuses on her looking unappealing and making grunts and facial grimaces from beginning to end.I imagine JLO sat at a computer, and instructed the AI to write a script that gave her maximum face time, included a dystopian future, and lots of CGI.Don't waste your time."

She is not an action hero. Really needed someone else. Her acting was unrealistic and her hair always in her face, drove me crazy!' Thought one of the best parts was every time Casca came back!!! The other characters were ok and some could have had more screen time. Especially Smith. Really liked the personality given to Smith. It made watching some scenes more enjoyable than just watching the other nonsense stuff. I don't know anything about the director and others, but I do know what I like. This wasn't it."
"10","Fantastic!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9806596/?ref_=tt_urv","deescottlass-73676","24 May 2024","I was hooked from start to finish. Jennifer is under estimated for her acting and I forgot she was JLo. All actors in the cast were fantastic. A lot reminded me of gamers set-up and not too far ahead technology facing us all. The part where the audience connect us the with the moral dilema of AI. I was taken away from the usual reality tv story lines. All very Hollywood, CGI but it's entertaining. If I can switch off watching a movie that keeps me hooked, then a great job by the Director and Producers and whole team. The graphics are fantastic! If this is not the genre for lukecthen why diss it?! But if you want to be entertained away from reality tv, then this is an alternative watch."
"2","Derivative, Cringe, Poor Acting, Poor Writing","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9813146/?ref_=tt_urv","simonbysouth","28 May 2024","What a mess. This film covers no new ground, only retreads tropes and plot points from other films that did it much better.From the acting, to the designs, to the script, to the plot, there's so many elements of this film to make you cringe. It was really hard to watch without awkwardly laughing AT it.JLo should NOT have been in this role. A complete miscast. Some actors can carry a film on their back but sadly, she could not.The writing is unsure if it wants to be a comedy or hardcore and misses on both. None of the (what I think were supposed to be) jokes landed, nor did any of the plot points hit hard. Overall the plot makes very little sense once you give it half a second of thought.What was the message this film was trying to say? Definitely nothing meaningful, and what dregs of spurious message one can squeeze out of it seems juvenile at best."
"2","Please make her stop screaming","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9813038/?ref_=tt_urv","slnadhi","28 May 2024","Stopped watching an hour in because I literally could not keep listening to JLO whine, scream, and moan. She does not have the acting chops to carry screen time by herself for so long. The story seemed like it could have been good. The effects were awesome but who thought JLO was the right fit for this?!? I probably could have fast forwarded through a large part of the first hour and not missed much. Smith gave more interest than JLO screaming. This movie probably could have been great if the storyline was made much more interesting in the first hour and they found someone much more versatile than JLO to play the lead."

I hated her the entire movie. She is pathetic, whiny and useless for most of the movie in the most annoying way, it's just lame. I do not know if it was how she was written or just her mediocre acting skills. The visuals are fantastic, the fights scenes are fun but JLO just ruins it for me.When she finally overcomes her own stupidity, it kind of gets better but the first half of the movie is excruciating, the second half only marginally better. You are warned. The ONLY reason I give this a 3 instead of a 1 is because of the visuals. I can only hope that JLO retires from acting after this dismal performance. This movie was doomed from the start and I really wish it wasn't:("

Immediately from the get go, the storyline caught my attention, and as weary as I was about JLO's acting, she delivered!The script did a great job with laying all the pieces of the puzzle in front of the viewer, then slowly puts the pieces of the puzzle together as to unveil the final picture in the end. It had a unique approach to the stereotype given to Artificial Intelligence and convinced viewers that we shouldn't be afraid of technology in the future. The unique dynamic between man and machine and how they can actually coexist was a interesting angle. Jennifer Lopez did a great job with pulling us in into a world where ATLAS (AI), Psychological traumas, and fear can mix and blend perfectly to give you a very entertaining movie.The movie was honestly really well done! Say what you want, but JLO can act! The plot, the characters, the CGI, the scoring, and the costumes were very very well done!This movie gets two thumbs up!"
"1","Not Even Worth a Shrug","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9818374/?ref_=tt_urv","tigerfish50","31 May 2024","There's nothing to recommend about 'Atlas'. The trailer promises the glimmer of an idea, but once the film starts, every worthwhile possibility in this saga of human-AI conflict sinks to the level of a juvenile comic book. Story, dialog, acting, direction, action sequences and sci-fi background are all inept to the point of embarrassment. The CGI is better than average, but it's undermined by the shortcomings of every other element. Nothing is at stake because neither story nor characters have any credibility in a world where a journey of 2.5 million light years appears to take as long as a transatlantic flight .Early on, the viewer is informed Jennifer Lopez' character Atlas is a rebellious super-smart AI programmer, and mankind's best hope to outwit the villainous AI mastermind. It's swiftly revealed she's just a middle-aged hot mess wearing too much make-up and skin-tight outfits. In the past, Lopez has shown acting ability, but there's none of that on display here. As a producer she should have known better than to cast herself in such sad and boring drivel."

The film could be good if the story line had some meaningful twist...all i could see is Jennifer's worst acting ever....i dont know why directors and producers are still going for that old lady when new young actors are on the field...next time please dont intake jenifer to any of movie or else the whole movie will get spoiled because of her."

Amazing visuals, 10/10, very entertaining action scenes.The Bad:
Everything else.-Acting... I really like J-Lo but she's struggling here. Too melodramatic, too over the top, I don't know if it was her or maybe the script forced her to act this way, but acting is like 4/10. Same with the rest of the characters. Again, some likes from the script are super cringe so maybe it wasn't her fault, she did what she could given what she had to work with.-The plot is... meh. It's a movie you've seen a thousand times, basic, by the book, same formula, same story, nothing new at all.-The characters are beyond dumb. First, Atlas, who just behaves like a grandma who doesn't want to install apps on her smartphone because she's afraid of technology. Then the evil guy who ""sees everything coming"" and he couldn't see the ""ending""? Really? Dumbest AI villain ever.-Comedy. When it wants to be funny, it's not. Mainly when Atlas behaves like a grandma who's frustrated because she can't make the microwave work, she's not funny. But when a lot of dumb soldiers say ""we're invincible, nothing could happen to us"" and they all just die in the first action scene and we're supposed to feel sad about them, it's just hilarious. Dumbest soldiers ever.It's a movie you've seen a thousand times, it just copies characters, dialogs, plot, twists... everything from other movies, it has nothing new to offer.Speaking of AI, it felt like the plot was written using ChatGPT."

This is more like a family styled scifi adventure action film. It's upbeat, funny, and heartwarming.This is a movie about friendship, trust, and there's good & evil in everything. It was entertaining and fun to watch. I can relate to Atlas's journey to gain trust. I like how she build a bond with Smith. It's very heartwarming. Also I love the movie doesn't take themselves too seriously. It's got a lot of funny moments and cute interactions. It's quite refreshing to see a different side of JLO. Definitely recommend if you are at home and want something entertaining to watch."
"5","Not bad!!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9809469/?ref_=tt_urv","shashank-iiitm08","26 May 2024","I was expecting worse but this turns out to be entertaining.If you liked this title then I'd recommend you play the game Titanfall 2. Game's story is better and you personally get to use most of the weapons displayed in the movie. They added a bit of Terminator into the mix and turned it into another hybrid. Initially, I was surprised if this wasn't a spinoff of one of the Titanfalls storylines.How does most of the movies end up with the same conclusion? In order to save humanity, you need to wipe most of them out? AI is not even remotely close to that possibility yet.PS: JLo needs to standby for Titanfall!"
"5","Useless language and pouting","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9823269/?ref_=tt_urv","dbakyle","2 June 2024","The constant use of foul language needlessly with Atlas whining takes away from the movie. Potential wasted. Went into the movie expecting something great and wanted to like it. Shortly after starting I had to excuse my daughter and watched the rest of the movie myself. It turned out to be something less than expected. I've been told I can enjoy and watch even the dumbest film and this felt like a chore to make it through. After stopping I just couldn't let it go that I hadn't finished so my advice, if you want a cleaner movie to watch; look elsewhere. If you don't care about the needless language or whining and like sci-fi then you may very well enjoy it."
"5","Good background movie","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9808678/?ref_=tt_urv","meabundantone","25 May 2024","I think JLo shines when she plays a vulnerable character who has to learn to be assertive and overcome something. Enough and Selena come to mind. But shes not a good fit to play a hardass. Shes pretty good in the last scene with Smith.Fantastic special effects! Great potential story, i actually hope someone else produces and casts a part 2.Overall the movie is okay. But sadly predictable. JLo isnt a good fit for this type of role. I really liked the Harlan and Smith characters, they seemed to have more depth and complexity than the Atlas role.Not terrible but glad Im on the couch watching it-ish while doing other things."
"3","Bad on so many levels.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9809074/?ref_=tt_urv","AsianTalentHollywood","26 May 2024","This has so many flaws starting with the horrific script that's so generic it was probably written by the terrorist bot in the movie. Jennifer Lopez proves why every movie she does flops. Her performance is so stiff and she can't wing it like she can in a romantic comedy. Then there is the action sequences that one would hope could give enough eye candy to keep you awake, but there are stupid things happening that don't make sense or are not explained. And finally, her obsession and anger go on and on and it is so tedious all the way down to her bonding moment with her bot. ""Eye roll."" Simu Liu adds nothing. This movie is a showcase of everything that's wrong with Hollywood filmmaking."

Any actor that had to deal with this script would struggle to make it work. Secondly, I really wanted to like this movie so Im sad I have to write this review.Atlas is a B movie that has such a bad plot that I really can't reconcile the money that must've been spent making it. I've seen a lot of Sci-Fi movies and I can honestly say every scene in Atlas is plagiarized. There's a bit of Enders Game, large slices of Alien, Aliens, Alien Prometheus, RoboCop, and Starship Troopers. There are whole lines of dialog I recognized from Ex Machina, MadMax, M3gan.... and anyone who has seen Morgan from 2016, well OMG!Despite all that Atlas is no better than a bad episode of Love, Death & Robots. Infact gi and watch that instead!"

It held my attention from start to finish, it had a sense of humor and plenty of peril. Jennifer holds her own really well in a movie that has to depend on her completely (apart from the voice acting for her AI suit). I never thought I'd become so fond of a disembodied voice. It made me laugh and it made me cry. And it had the absolute perfect ending. Terrific CGI, fun script, good acting, and the two hours or so flew past without me looking at my watch once. It's a film I'd have paid to see in a theater, but thankfully, I got to watch it on the couch instead."

JLo is not a good lead actress choice for a sci-fi.... she's a dancer / singer not an actor!Yes, there are some other good acting choices, but even they can't save a truly rubbish storyline!This is the worse kind of sci-fi movie..... super mechanized human operated robots reminiscent of Avatar, space craft traveling to the Andromeda Galaxy in real time, fighting an omnipotent AI, etc, aarrgghh!The CGI is good though, but that's about the only good thing I can say about it.Alien world is reminiscent of Vin Diesel's planet Helion Prime in the excellent sci-fi movie, but here's its cold.JLo must need the money!"
"2","Just Jo-Lo tantrum and tears","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9814735/?ref_=tt_urv","Martipee","29 May 2024","The initial promo's made out this to be an entertaining sci-fi movie, with Jo-Lo as the drawcard in an action thriller. Could and should have been a simple recipe for success, but unfortunately was never going to happen. The opening scene of Lopez waking up gave lots of hints away.What was to emerge as a main theme was the constant and annoying tantrums and crying of Lopez. The first hour was dedicated to her never-ending emotional outbursts followed by the last hour of monotonous tearful regrets.(If anyone wants to watch a soapie, I would recommend Hallmark!)I can only assume the writers believed the character was deeply entrenched in that monthly female issue every woman endures. By the middle of the movie, I was hoping the bad guy would finally appear, and win, just to shut her up.Another disappointing movie and maybe a sign for her to stick to rom-coms rather than anything intelligent or entertaining, and one where female whining is deemed necessary."
"10","Great Sci-fi flick","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9807237/?ref_=tt_urv","pdxqraj","25 May 2024","This is an engaging sci-fi flick with an all star cast. Really can't get much better than this, especially on Netflix. I would have definitely paid to see this at the theater.Jennifer Lopez does a great job as the main protagonist, and Simu Liu is exceptional as the antagonist. Props to the supporting cast, as Sterling Brown, Mark String and Lana Parilla consistently bring their best.Smith's voice actor is witty and hilarious as well. Great story about the effects of human hubris, and not understanding the impact of developing and unleashing sentient beings. Great cinematography and sound design as well. Great movie!"
"4","The Taste of Stale Popcorn","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9809352/?ref_=tt_urv","Tweetienator","26 May 2024","Another Netflix generic - the trouble with Atlas is not the production or the acting, but the story. Once again, in every scene, I'm reminded that I'm being served something I've already seen many times, maybe too many times. I don't expect every script or story to be something uber-special or extraordinary, but when you find yourself doing something else while watching a movie, you know it's not too good. I guess some editing could have improved the movie. The scenes that precede any substantial events could be cut down to a few minutes. The idea that a movie has to hit the 2-hour mark or longer is tiresome. If you don't have something really good and interesting to tell, every additional minute makes the story fall more and more apart. Anyway, if you want some explosions and computer-generated effects, Atlas will do. If you want characters you care about, witty and intelligent dialogue, and a really creative storyline, this is the wrong place to look. Verdict: a movie that is the equivalent of a cheeseburger from one of those big franchise companies (made with the same care and protocols), and at best, a mediocre action show most will forget within a few hours."

This film has garnered its fair share of negative reviews, and it's not hard to see why. From poorly written plotlines to predictable dialogue, ""Atlas"" seems to fall flat in many areas. On top of that, the lifeless acting does little to breathe excitement into the story. It really feels like they used AI to make this movie. With so many other great films out there to choose from, you may want to give ""Atlas"" a pass unless you're really keen on watching Jennifer Lopez in action."

In a surprising (and completely illogical) twist, the machines flees Earth. Twenty Eight years later, humanity must end what they started.I'm beyond impressed at how a seemingly generic sci-fi movie, can have this level of production, appealing visuals, as well as designs in general (alien planets, interfaces, technology). On the other hand, I'm equally disappointed on what the movie delivers as a story.The script is so vanilla, generic and predictable that it makes an otherwise excellent execution of an awful script, feel like a complete waste. Also, there are 4 actors on this movie, and I liked half of them.. neither were the lead or the villain and have little screen time. Sadly, Lopez is a detriment to the narrative, as the pacing tanks with her continuously stopping to deliberate on ""unfun"" ideas and awfully boring interactions. Also the action probably clocks at 30 minutes of a length of 2 hours!It does have an interesting technological idea that only works as a concepts. And many things require that you don't stop to think about anything, or your disbelief on your lead and technology would hamper whatever you can muster from this film.I would have loved for someone with an interesting idea to have had access to this level of polish and delivery.Can you imagine them producing a (good) Gundam movie that looks like this!?"

Stellar performances by everyone!Jennifer Lopez is too good!This character Atlas is a different kind of character, and it fits her well.Sometimes you have to ask one question.Can AI be trusted?I guess we can never know sometimes. I like the humor in this being with the action packed moments.Jennifer Lopez did produce this after all.The humor was spot on in certain moments.The story was pretty good. AI can turn on us someday and that is truly frightening.This film actually had me siding with an AI for a bit. Atlas actually ended up doing pretty well with the tech suit.She never knew how she could trust anybody. But Smith was the one who earned that trust the right way."

When I saw the preview for this movie I pretty much knew what it was going to be. The is low IQ schlock to munch popcorn to, it's not some serious well thought out sci-fi. I'd even go as far as to say it was better than The Creator, because this at least didn't pretend to be something good. One of the odd things to me was constantly referring to the androids as ""AI"", which was probably just because that's the big buzzword right now and the marketing department demanded the robots all be referred to as AIs. I'll give Jennifer Lopez credit because I assumed this would be 100% her acting in a box for 1 day on set, but it was more like 80%. I did notice that Mark Strong's scenes all seemed to be in one room. My biggest complaint is the stupid robot sword, but whatever.Kids will certainly enjoy it, and if you can turn your brain off for 2 hours it's entertaining. It's like Robot Jox with a budget."

I needed to leave this movie not even at half. It's so easy to understand what going to happen. Wasted million of dollars, story deserve it for sure. Eventhough you could figure out end of story in the beginning of the movie, you would interested how it will get that point. But once I seen jlo carrying a chees with herself as a proof she is ""actually"" smart and the acts she was doing same over and over again for basic scenes.. I couldn't watch anymore."

The concept was interesting and the idea of a galactic war between humans and rogue AI had a lot of potential.Instead what we got was an intransigent lead who spends the first hour shouting at a machine that's trying to save her life. She's overly emotional, largely unstable, and her charm wears off very quickly.Jennifer is that unbearable, know-it-all, too sarcastic too pessimistic, shrilly pushy type. She's the acquaintance most of us prefer not to be around, and we are better off for it.If you still insist on watching this, prepare for staid dialogue and predictability."

Critics are often and unfairly harsh on Ms. Lopez, but here, she truly shines, bringing unparalleled life and authenticity to her role. Her performance is compelling and transformative, making the film feel both real and immersive. Despite unfair rankings, I predict this movie is destined to become a cult classic. Released at a perfect moment with all the AI and tech developments, ""Atlas"" is a standout, innovative addition to the sci-fi horror genre. Netflix has struck gold with this one, offering a fresh narrative that captivates and challenges. If you don't get it today, you'll likely become a fan tomorrow. More films like this, please!

This movie is the obvious example of how important is to choose an actor for your role.They could have gone with Sandra Bullock or Will Smith or any other REAL Actor, both of which would have been great for this part but instead, they ruined a very nice movie and millions of dollars on a dinosaur.IMHO J Lo should stick to singing and leave acting to real actors. This movie could have been even better than Gravity or I-Robot but choosing one wrong actor has ruined it all.Which actors or actresses do you guys think could have been great in Atlas's role, playing in J Lo's stead?"

However, the plot could have been better because the show was a cross between ""Flight of the Navigator"" and ""Gravity"" minus the acting and writing skills, so why make it focus mainly on the one person? The dialogue, not funny. I maybe laughed once or twice, but it was trying hard to be funny. Maybe the writing? Maybe the delivery? And one more huge problem, the actors were one-dimensional stock characters. Again one person is designed to carry the movie and doesn't deliver. And the cool secondary characters die off early. And the bad guy is all bad. Well as a viewer I'm thinking ""shrug"" don't care about any of them. I liked the movie, but I feel talents were wasted. Just because there's a huge singer star who produced the movie, doesn't mean they dont have to share the spotlight. This is no Gravity or Flight of the Navigator or Short Circuit. Build a team and it would have succeeded. To have them die at the beginning? Whack."

This movie is so bad I stopped watching it three times and i'm still not at the end. Story is bland and has been done a million times before. CGI is ok. What makes me really hate this movie is the casting of jennifer lopez. All she does is whining and crying throughout the movie. I love sci fi movies and have seen a lot of it, but never such a main character you hate more and more as the movie continues. If the had casted a different lead and cut out the continues crying it could have been an ok movie. I have still 40 minutes to go but I allready know how this is going to end. 1 star for me."

I after they tried to took control over mankind. We've seen hundreds of these types of movies since last 40 yrs of Hollywood but somehow I found this movie amazing. Mainly because of good visual effects and high octane action scenes especially during free fall sequence and Climax. It reminded me of sci fi movies I grew up watching when I was in high school like Battle Los Angeles, Pacific Rim, Edge of Tomorrow, Oblivion etc. So that maybe a reason I enjoyed it very much... The main character played by JenLo aka Atlas Shepherd was written in a good way, story was engaging, cinematography and music was good and as I've said before action scenes were also amazing featuring A. I Exo Suits, Robots, Machine guns, lasers etc, as you expect from a sci fi action movie.. I hope NF will continue to make these type of movies do i can watch them without caring about haters.. Because I love futuristic Sci Fi movies..."

In my opinion, the story itself was decent enough that anyone besides JLo would've been able to carry the lead character. She didn't make the film better or worse so I'm not sure how she was even casted for a sci-fi story with such a magnitude of awesome CGI. This was definitely a decent watch giving off vibes of Avatar, T2, and the TV series Humans throughout.....peace to fallen."

J-Lo has never been a great actor, yet someone thought she'd be able to carry this movie on her own with the help of a talking... whatever the giant walking things from Avatar are called.The film starts off promising, but quickly descends into a painful exchange between Lopez' Atlas and a walking computer. There's a lot of exposition, mainly after they sync, which becomes annoying because if they're synced, conversations don't need to happen.But I digress. There seems a lack of clear direction, which everyone saying their lines waiting for the credits to roll. It's hard to act when your face is full of Botox, because you lack expression.Recommended with a big bucket of popcorn, a lot of alcohol, and nothing better to do on a Saturday night."
"5","A passable film if we ignore the main role","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9811331/?ref_=tt_urv","celikup","27 May 2024","A science fiction film can hardly surprise the viewer after so many titles that are regularly released for the big screen or television. So in this film we can often see similarities and even the use of the same motifs. If we ignore for a moment the plot, which is connected to the current issues of artificial intelligence, it seems to me that the main actress is the biggest weight of the film. I believe that the film would have received much better ratings if a new and less exposed actress appeared in the lead role. Maybe the production's hope was that the name Jenifer Lopez would attract viewers, but I have a feeling that it went to their heads. We are used to seeing Lopez in rom-com movies or possibly comedies. A sci-fi action in which she would have to convince us that being a scientist just doesn't suit her. That is, it is not convincing."
"2","Low IQ movie with an intolerably annoying protagonist (Jennifer Lopez)","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9823126/?ref_=tt_urv","TrustworthyReviews","2 June 2024","No spoilers.Positive(s): Good cinematography.Negatives:
This is another film where people, who are not intelligent, attempt to write intelligent dialogue. Within the first few minutes we (my girlfriend and I) were bombarded/littered with mind-numbing cliches and stereotypes. These low IQ writers thought if Jennifer plays chess, not that we see any, viewers will automatically thing she's smart because that's what they think intelligence means. Where's the vomit bucket?She's also extremely annoying, as some have already mentioned in their comments, because of her constant whining, crying, screaming and blatantly unashamed arrogance.The problem with unlikeable, opinionated, ignorant and arrogant protagonists is that it becomes impossible to root for them to win and so the movie fails. Jennifer Lopez's character thinks she ""knows it all"" and doesn't need any advice from anyone.I feel nauseous writing this, as someone who was once a fan of Jennifer Lopez, so the film receives 2/10 for the visuals, 0/10 for story, dialogue, acting and Jennifer being the most unlikeable protagonist I've ever had to suffer in a movie.Netflix: Would you recommend this film?My answer: Hell NO!"

An incredible movie , the acting is great ! Not to mention the special effects in the film, it's just an incredible picture! There is a lot of meaning in the film, which stretches to the end! There are moments of humor and moments when you can't hold back the tears! I will definitely recommend this movie to watch! Really worth a look!In my opinion, this is one of Jennifer's best works! It feels like she got used to the role of Atlas!What pleases is that the plot is not predictable! That's why the movie looks in one go! 10/10 my rating."

I do not know how. I am disarmed. I'm intrigued. Terribly predictable, sad, full of plot amor, and just... wow. It is like new low for me. This movie offends me and I'm delayed. I can't help but admire that someone wrote it, someone accepted it and someone implemented it. An incredible loss. There was supposed to be Titanfall with Blizzard cinematic vibe and nothing would make it better than the great JoLo. This is the most unsuccessful plagiarism I have ever seen. At 22 minutes you know how the movie will end and you know it's not going to be good. I give 1 for the actors, 1 for the mechs, 1 for the cgi. It was nice to go back to the 80s, but unfortunately no healthy nerve cells followed. I'm sure the script was written with the help of AI, but wow... It is auful."

Girlboss action with a sci-fi twist that we've seen a million times already. The most recycled and clich√© story you'll ever watch. Within the first 15 minutes, a mech suit gives you its pronouns.I honestly can't with this garbage. The best I can say about it is that it was just about watchable and the effects are about average.At 2 hours, it felt longer than Oppenheimer and Killers Of The Flower Moon, combined. What a slog. There are 200 other girlboss films that are better than this and I wouldn't give any of them more than 4 stars.A strong, intelligent female lead and a clich√© story are just about all it takes to make a big budget movie these days."

I don't know if it's just that poorly written that every actor seems so awful. It is so bad it comes across as a b movie but without any charm or humor. Lopez character is screechy and off putting. The space effects are pretty though. I have to say I just can't drum up any interest in what is going to happen. I don't like to pan movies but as a sci fan I'm just so disappointed. Hsp hooes it's a fresh alternative to terminator movies but sadly, it's not. Unwatchable. I keep waiting to see. I really can only stand the robots voices in this
They are much better than j lo is and I am rooting for extinction of the human race frankly."

It's a fun movie for the complete family. The. Music was just okay it wasn't that great . I wanted more story development but the story is solid. I can't wait to rewatch this movie again and understand it more everyone forgets Jennifer is a hell of an actress.

Bad acting, bad scripts, boring jokes.The girl can't act. Quit giving her any roles.

It's the worst trainwreck I've seen this year thus far. Honestly don't expect that to change either.I actually find it hilarious Netflix thought it was a good idea to make this disaster with one of the worst actress of all time.Turned this thing off an hour in.

The fact that it was clich√©d and seemed to have been written by a committee who had trawled other films to find the most banal AI goes rogue plot lines, that Lopez's character was unbelievable and hackneyed, that all the other characterisation was two dimensional and that the violence tried to make up for all these faults - well, I could tolerate them as I had fairly low expectations. The point at which I gave up was when Lopez's character said she knew the leader of the AI uprising was hiding in the Andromeda Galaxy. Really? Two and a half million light years away? A basic requirement of a science fiction film is that the science is at least halfway credible."

The interaction with the AI I found very pleasing. All told a great, entertaining show.I have been told by the AI that my review is too short, ha ha, now that is a joke. Well to fill out the words I will go into what I think about Jennifer's performance. I have only seen her as a singer and on one of those talent shows, but here she gives a great performance. Believable and with great acting. Hope you have enjoyed my review!"

Her constant crying was distracting. And the unneeded curse word in a clearly youth based movie in line with Star Wars is discussing! The special effects and idea of AI taking over the world where is a pretty good concept very kindly today when everyone is worried about AI wiping out the Internet overall I'd like the movie. I just did not like that. They had to cuss so much. We are better writers we can write a story without using hell damn and cuss words every single paragraph I would not allow my young kids to watch this movie. Yes, I know that kids hear it all the time. Yes, I know it's in rap music and their favorite anime shows but parent I do not have to let my children hear that kind of language when I try to teach them better , other than that, the movies OK."

I had been put off by all the bad reviews, but I should know by now not to listen to them. The film kept my attention which a lot of films now days do not. It got straight to the point and did not have any fillers. I wasn't looking at my watch constantly to see what time it was or how long I had left which I do with lots of films. Jennifer Lopez was Good and the visuals we're better than some of the Marvel films I seen recently it had action sci-fi and the sense of humour give it a chance and you will enjoy it. Hopefully Netflix will make a sequel."

Then someone said let's cast JLo , as she's got the acting chops of Tommy cruise, Arnie, Brucie Willis. All wrapped together.Oh dear oh dear oh dear, she singly hardly ruins what could have been a decent film. Terrible acting, constant wineing , then the director aims all the film at her backstory and after the whole crew gets taken out , somehow an analyst with no field experience becomes a killing machine!!!!Sterling k brown was good, but too short a part , if he was the main character this would have been an 8/10 sort of film.Worth the watch, some nice touches, but jenny should stay in the block & hang up her acting flip flopsüôÑ"
"5","Plot, dialogue and performances on-par with a video game","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9826160/?ref_=tt_urv","rhett-p","4 June 2024","If this actually was a video game it might be better received lol. Very little emotional weight despite J-Lo spending half the movie crying and wailing. Outside of her performance the rest of an otherwise decent cast does their best with the material provided.The plot is wafer thin, with the only twist (if you can call it that) not really doing much to elevate what is ultimately a pedestrian and ""by the numbers"" script.The production values deserve some praise, and their are a couple of decent sequences, but very little done in terms of ""world building"".Bottom line: Would I recommend it? While it's better than many of Netflix's other feature film offerings, that's not really saying a lot. It's certainly not offensively bad, but it's probably better suited as something to throw on in the background, to look in on occasionally, while you're doing something else."
"5","A very mediocre one","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9821224/?ref_=tt_urv","JonyVeana","2 June 2024","Everything that they told you about this movie is true, its just a very forgettable movie with ok special effects, Lopez its like always a pain to look, she is not a very charismatic person and she its not a movie star, she is maybe a music star i don't really know because im not a girl and i don't listen to her music to be honest, she is just always with the same face and she kinda looks bored, Ben didn't teacher her any acting tips, they were only doing you know what, so that's a problem specially with the other good character of sterling K Brown, he is just a most charming human being and he should be the protagonist."

The worse AI movie to date with poor cinema experience and the worst actress in the industry go hand in hand with deep NF pockets. Why in the world would they want us to watch and old Latina woman act a poor role when she can't even keep a straight smile in real life. Hit the thumbs down on NF, avoid this cheaply made version of a I and rewatch AI with Jude law to rebuttal. The director threw anything together, the actors were chose on random and the protagonist is going through a meltdown both on screen and in real life."

I did enjoy this movie and I thought she did a good job. I feel Jlo is very versatile, she can sing, act, put on concerts, and she still looks good is probably why so many people hate on her. No she is not old and washed up, no more than say Arnold or Sylvester Stallone but you'll never hear people say they're old and washed up which proves double standard. After watching this maybe I feel differently about AI, scary stuff. The special effects were not bad, I've seen better but that didn't ruin the movie for me. So for the haters, I did like the movie I gave the rating I feel it deserve, and no I don't know Jlo nor was I involved in this movie."

Besides a story that is as boring as it is unoriginal, we also have JLo, a wilting actress who is hoping to land a role that will fit her like a glove. Well, this role fit her like a glove... a glove pulled over a leg. Her acting is so fake, she just doesn't have the ability to get you there, to connect with the character, she's playing cheap theatre that really lowers the quality of the film. But let's leave her alone for a bit and stick to the effects, my favorites and the stars of Atlas.. wtf was that? Instead of some jaw-dropping effects, the guys only had the budget for a gaming designer who made a real sci-fi robot game out of this movie. By the way, I thought there was some robot game like this on the phone around 2010? Or is the enhanced replica of the Avatar suit not going to be that eye popping?Either way, there's too much to comment on and not positive. Atlas is weak, as is the lead actress.. I'm glad she played Atlas and not Rebel Moon though, that would have been a tragedy üòÖ"
"4","Atlas"": A Sci-Fi Misfire Despite Lopez's Star Power","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9813887/?ref_=tt_urv","doyler79","28 May 2024","The new sci-fi drama starring Jennifer Lopez, Atlas by Brad Peyton, tries to touch upon some important issues associated with artificial intelligence and human survival but, in the end, seems unable to succeed in these serious intentions. The movie stars Jennifer Lopez as Atlas Shepherd, a data analyst who has a radical distrust of AI but is compelled to work with it during the most critical of missions on a hostile planet. Instead, it has an extremely derivative and predictable plot that borrows from far superior sci-fi works to do nothing to contribute to the genre. Despite Jennifer Lopez obviously trying, her performance is called weak and not strong enough to drag the movie out of numerous other issues. Aesthetically, ""Atlas"" is displeasing; its looks seem like those of a low-quality video game rather than those of a high-stakes sci-fi thriller. This added to agonizingly awkward dialogue and unimpressive special effects makes watching the movie a real ordeal rather than a delightful experience. What is more, the inorganic manner in which the film constructs its human-AI relations results in being quite strained. The very strained relationship between this character, played by Lopez, and the AI entity with which she is supposed to cooperate is not convincing, and the message the moviemakers aimed to convey in terms of trust and cooperation is hollow and not authentic. In general, ""Atlas"" is a very big disappointment because high expectations have been set by the involvement of Jennifer Lopez and a genuinely intriguing premise for a film. Although it might do for background viewing, it left out that thought-provoking element of an interesting sci-fi adventure and thus can only rate 4 out of 10."

Cheesy music.Ridiculous fight scenes. Crazy obsession with coffee and chess. JLo sobs, cries and squeals her way through this. Never mind the laws of physics - an analyst outlasts her entire squadron of troops and - of course - rescues the mission from the very brink of disaster. The AI in this film seems to consist of a 3D laser-projected image of a spinning pebble with a voice like Hal, lots of swishy screens and a neon green hearing aid. Watch out for the magic flaming sword, several squishy heads and a mysteriously painless compound fracture of the tibia."

It was a little corny and predictable in parts, but fun, sassy, emotional, and poignant at times.J Lo certainly holds it, but Smith was a great co-star even though you never see him.The gradual exposure of J Lo's character was well done. Parts were unbelievable, given the advanced tech of the time, some of the detection of attacks you'd think would have been possible, but I guess ""plot armour"", or whatever the opposite of that is...Don't expect too much, but it's fun if you suspend disbelief. The music is pretty good for a non blockbuster which helps a lot."

She's the same in every movie and now irrelevant. She is also just a terrible person in general. Jennifer does not have any range in her acting (especially her singing) and has no talent for this business. I've seen a lemon produce a better emotional scene than her.If you want to waste time, put this on your tv, or anything she does. The monotone dialogue she spews will resemble an ASMR atmosphere, helping you fall asleep faster than counting sheep.I don't know why Hollywood continues to hire her."

The issue of being an adult and continue all mad at the world and feeling sorry for oneself but at the same time enjoying a privilege life it is too tiresome and first world issues.

I just keep asking myself why was this movie even brought into production...it had not an ounce of feeling....and felt sorta robotic...kinda like to robots in the film................

The ongoing harping by the AI suit to pick up and wear the link and then BE OPEN to it so you can SYNC is so in your face. It's just an NLP primer for people to get the device and use it when it comes available.The acting is good and the cgi is over the top and at times so busy it's hard to follow however you get there.There is a story.

Netflix and chill does not always mean watching what's the latest but what's is the most content worth watching over and over thru the years.Parasyte, Godzilla minus one, even some Anime movies are so much better in making the viewers truly experience something unique instead of Hollywood films.I did finish the movie but like others mention the acting was horrible.

So, Jennifer's emotional range in the film was just mind-blowing - all she did was scream, swear, and throw tantrums. It's like watching a toddler on a sugar rush, but less adorable. And can we talk about depth? Because her character was about as deep as a kiddie pool.The plot? Oh, honey, I saw that coming from a mile away. Spoiler alert: Atlas gets what she wants. Shocking, right? And let's not forget the supporting cast, who were basically furniture because Jennifer needed to hog every single spotlight. Please, no sequel. Save your money, folks. Instead of wasting it on another snooze-fest, invest in some acting lessons for Jennifer - girl needs it - and maybe throw in some scriptwriting workshops while you're at it.Here's an idea: try being original for once. Break the mould, like Atlas and Smith. Surprise us, do something unexpected. And hey, while you're at it, add some depth to the characters and maybe, just maybe, consider adding some diversity to the cast. Crazy concept, I know."

I was anticipating the release of this one but unfortunately it ultimately turned out to be a disappointment! Why? Not because of the story. Not because of the acting. Not because of the CGI. It was because of the language. Too much blasphemy! It's bothersome that religious exclamations are not considered profanity. In my opinion, they are the worst and most disrespectful words that can be said...far worse than the F word. I was raised to not use that type of language.

"2","Netflix has made another trash","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9811984/?ref_=tt_urv","jaysonpajaronvistal","27 May 2024","Netflix's latest entry to the sci-fi genre, ""Atlas"" is, sadly, an unmitigated disaster in so many aspects. The film follows a brilliant data analyst with a deep distrust of AI and finds it may be her only hope when a mission to capture a renegade robot goes awry. The premise itself may sound interesting and unique, but it's very convoluted and messy, setting the movie for the chaos that unfolds as the movie progresses. If there is another level of ""6 feet below the ground"" disappointment, this movie hits rock bottom and digs even deeper.Jennifer Lopez has made herself one of our beloved actresses and singers, with standout performances in films like ""Selena,"" ""Maid in Manhattan,"" ""Hustlers,"" (in which she should have been nominated for Best Supporting Actress at the Academy that year), and even Tarsem Singh's dark and experimental movie ""The Cell"". Her talent in acting is undeniable, but her latest performance in ""Atlas"" is a stark departure from her former glamor days in acting. While she does what she thinks best for a movie that is lacking in creativity and uniqueness, unfortunately, her performance is also a far cry from her usual standard. As an avid fan of movies, I always think that a strong performance can elevate an otherwise subpar movie and an actor can only give a good or bad performance if the script is great or not, sadly, JLo's efforts fall flat, exacerbating the film's numerous flaws. It's hard to comprehend what made her agree to this downright formulaic movie.Whilst the movie intends to deliver a fun adventurous sci-fi flick, unfortunately, it delivers nothing but convoluted and disjointed storytelling. The concept of a data analyst teaming up with an AI to capture another robot may, on paper, sound interesting, but in execution, it falls into this formulaic sci-fi flick that goes nowhere but downhill. The plot of the movie is riddled with clich√©s and predictability, making it a slog and hard to get through.""Atlas"" is clearly a missed opportunity on so many fronts. The pacing is painfully slow and sluggish, dragging the viewers through scenes that feel endless and meaningless. Character development is nonexistent to other characters except for the protagonist, leaving the audience with only one character to connect to despite having so many characters that are being introduced. With storytelling that is generic and uninspired, leaning towards the edge of campiness but never fully committing, resulting in a narrative that is confusing, shallow, and painfully generic.While the movie attempts to address a very relevant and timely issue which is the use of AI and its implications in today's society, it does so in a way that feels heavy-handed and demotivated. The movie tries to convey themes of family, loyalty, and the ethical use of advanced technology, but these elements feel recycled and trite. The action sequences also lacked originality and felt uninspired. It's as if the movie is trying to say something profound but gets lost in its own noise, leaving the audience with a hollow experience.The premise of ""Atlas"" feels like someone who has a vendetta against AI decided to make a movie about it and let AI write and direct it. The result is a film that is nonsensical, emotionless for a supposed romance, and oftentimes ridiculous. The dialogues are high-end cringe-worthy, cheaper than thrift shop finds, and fail to engage or resonate. The title ""Atlas"" suggests a sense of weight and importance, but the film itself should have been left on the cutting room floor.One of the most glaring issues of the movie is its lack of emotional depth. For a film that attempts to explore complex themes, it falls short of delivering any meaningful emotional impact. The romance subplot is lifeless and devoid of any genuine connection, making it hard for viewers to invest in the characters. Visually, the movie is also a mixed bag. While there are moments of impressive special effects, they are overshadowed by the movie's overall lackluster direction and cinematography. The action sequences, which should be the film's highlight, are poorly choreographed and copied from video games, which failed to generate any real excitement. Every aspect of this movie falls into an overall sense of mediocrity.In conclusion, ""Atlas"" is a film that promises much but delivers little. Its convoluted plot, lackluster performances, and uninspired direction make it hard to watch. Jennifer Lopez, despite her best efforts, is unable to salvage a film that is fundamentally flawed in every aspect. While the movie attempts to tackle important themes related to AI and its role in society, it does so in a way that feels heavy-handed and unoriginal. In a landscape filled with innovative and thought-provoking sci-fi films, ""Atlas"" stands out as a glaring misstep. While the title of the movie is ""Atlas,"" they should have just kept it in the draft."

It would have been really cool had it took me to an Atlas Mara Shepherd's profile page or something similar. For a movie dealing with AI just feels that they could have gone the extra length with this one, and I fail to see how they missed it as they have clearly done a closeup scene of the tags. In the age of Netflix and hundreds of low budget and low quality movies details matter. Ahh... It is a nice movie, passes the time, nothing to rave about. J. Lo foxy as ever, she really ages nicely."

And not in a good way.At the beginning of the film is a scene where all the screens are going at once Man Who Fell to style. And that basically is what this film is. An over the top assault on your senses.If there's an opportunity to max it out this film does it. The battle scenes have way too many lasers firing and the explosions are way too big. The acting is the same. Lopez reactions are constantly over the top. In the early scenes she's too sulky, the too distressed, then too kick ass. You get the picture. This film is like Spinal Tap, turn everything to 11.If it was a parade like Hot Shots or Tropic Thunder it might just pull it off. But the film seems to want to be taken seriously. But you just can't because it's all too much!I'm not even sure if there's a plot in there. I was too distracted by the blunt extreme emotions and the massive explosions to notice.On top of that it feels like a bunch of cut scenes from a computer game stitched together interspersed with shots of Lopez. At times it's really jarring as you flick from Halo to what is supposed to be a live action movie."

Gravity is a constant so no object falls faster than another. Treating all viewers as morons just pisses off the educated viewers and we stop watching. Making a mockery of science for entertainments sake just makes the general population dumber as they are watching thinking they are learning something. Hollywood should be more responsible knowing that times have changed and the lesser educated don't differentiate between entertainment and reality. It's all one to them so nonsense and misinformation is blended into a distorted reality that appears superficially believable.Come on, the chess piece just appears at her feet in a battle zone of debris and chaos!"

Even though the idea for the story was not exactly original this could have been a cool sci-fi flic saved by action and cool special effects courtesy of CGI. But then the soup was utterly ruined by adding Lopez. Not only was she constantly overacting, but her ego which is as big as her gigantic bottom got the best of her. Lopez immediately turned Atlas into a totally unlikable character. She's constantly whining and hysterical and stays childishly stubborn. Even in life threatening situations she's just behaving like a complete moron. Throughout the film I could only imagine the pleasure of slapping her. Why Lopez was cast in this film is beyond me. Netflix keeps on spending huge amounts on terrible films. In my opinion the whole Netflix project development team should be fired."

"2","A movie intended to be blockbuster, pretending to be B on purpose and failing.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9808723/?ref_=tt_urv","haloumis","25 May 2024","The production team for this movie hired well known actors, there is lots of dialog and the script goes into the main characters in depth. There is humor action and lots of CGI. It should have been a great movie. The problem is that humor and dialog is sometimes obnoxious it is very difficult to sympathise with any of the characters and robots. Acting is a bit wooden and feels forced, void of emotion. JL and some of the other names did not deliver. I assume they intended to make the movie a bit cheesy on purpose, but because acting and dialogs are bad it is almost unwatchable.The CGI graphics are a mixed bag. Generally speaking is low cost. Some shots are OK but others lack detail. Textures are clean and looking plastic, though the character is marching through dirt and swamp. There are fighting scenes that looks amateur at best. The animation is unrealistic and effects are off."

The casting, the comedic script, the damn robot had more charisma than the actors combined. JLO BEGGING to practically join the mission thinking she's the only person that can stop the bad guy but constantly reminding everyone she's ""just an analyst"" throughout was getting on my nerves.If you wear hearing aids make sure you have them on the lowest setting or you'll instantly get a migraine from all the screeching coming out of JLO's mouth."

Was in the mood for a mindless si-fi action for a little bit of escape and entertainment. This movie did not reach that very low bar for me. I do not hate Jennifer Lopez. She achieved a whole lot in her life with the little talent she has. But the actress she is not. There were a couple of moments when she was somewhat bearable. But for the great majority of the movie it was just her face on the screen making all sorts of odd and irritating noses imitating what? Fear? Almost like a 3 year old would make when they really want something from you. She was so bad it was almost amusing. Anyway, I could not make it all the way through. Simply could not. Pass this one."

If it's a genre I'm interested in, I like to give it at least a shot. This film is fun! There's lots of action with humor. The FX are outstanding. Plays out well on a big screen. Relax with your bowl of popcorn and just let it play out. JLo is a fairly decent actress & her AI, Smith, who vaguely reminds me of Knight Rider, provides some witty banter. This is a film I would definitely buy for my collection. A fun ride and worth an 8/10 in my books. So don't believe all the haters without giving this film a shot! You might just be entertained."
"5","Watch J Lo doing J Lo things","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9809015/?ref_=tt_urv","jochang-30856","26 May 2024","That's all this movie is. Everything else is to accompany that in the most cliche and generic way. You know her character is smart because she plays chess. You know she's right because there's a cocky, armed tac squad that doesn't take her seriously. You know she's a brilliant analyst because everyone finds her difficult to work with. You know she will win once she confronts her past because that's simply how these things are. Oh yeah, and she's also addicted to caffeine. Cue feelings of amused endearment. This film is a vanity project that works because because the star is who she is. More celebrity than an actress nowadays, which is too bad because she actually is a decent actress if she would ever take a role for something worth watching.The special effects are generally good. Doesn't always blend well so it feels spotty in some parts. Meaning sometimes you can clearly tell there's nothing real on the screen either due to a lack of proper shadows or physics that don't quite sell. Others are so overdone and in your face that it's like a replacement for a plot that's actually worth a damn. The story and premise is the most bland and unsurprising thing ever. AI gone insane to protect human beings from themselves. If this was executed well, overplayed tropes don't really matter. But it wasn't. It happened in the dumbest way, full of nonsensical things that will make you ask, ""Why does she have that to begin with?"" or, ""Are there no safeguards to these things?"" You just have to accept that some events occurred without putting too much thought into it or risk feeling insulted that they felt this was believable enough to make you watch it in the first place.Simu Liu is terrible in this. Just awful. I like him in most other shows and films I've seen, but the poor attempt at an unfeeling, genocidal AI projecting malice but is actually trying to save the human race is just bad. So are the cheap-looking color contacts he wears so we know he's not human. The film itself is already kind of middling and this amplifies that. It's almost like they deliberately gave the least amount of effort required to establish him as a character. This is especially true during his origin story mentioned above, easily being the worst part of the entire thing.J Lo and Smith has some enjoyable dialogue. It's designed to elicit laughter and sometimes it lands. But really, you watch this movie because you want to watch J Lo. That's it. If you're good with that, it's not terrible. Might even be fun."

I always heard she wasn't a good actor but never gave her a chance. I finally watch a movie with her in it and I now understand what people were talking about wasn't horrible but I couldn't get into the movie as much because of her over emotional fake crying. I recommend giving the movie a chance though everyone has a different perspective! I hope you guys liked it more than I did."

By the end of the film it was very repetitive and predictable.There were also a lot of weird concepts borrowed from other films and that ruined the flow. JLo needing to physically walk in an fully AI robot exactly like they do in pacific rim non-ai mech made no sense. Almost like they were trying to oversell the actor's athleticism which was carefully curated through camera angles the entire film.You walk away with the feeling that the film was trying to hard in all the wrong places."

Instead I was surprised that I almost liked this, it was almost okay.The key word here is however ""almost"". This is almost good acted, it almost has good production value, the movie has almost good sound design, the story is almost good, JLo is okay too. There is always something lacking throughout this movie, like it is a teaser or the director refused to make it as good as it could have been.A couple of things are really good, such as the computer graphics, and I also really liked the ending. But this is just average at best. Worth the ticket price? Well, maybe, you could definitely do worse and you will not fall asleep or roll your eyes as one would do during the Dune franchise.I give this a 5/10. This is an inoffensive okay little adventure you can watch with your whole family. Today, that is almost an endorsement."

And yes, if you go into it already negativity biased, you're not giving it a chance. As a fan of Pacific Rim, Avatar and Alien, I dont mind another Mech movie, as this one adds a unique twist based on a significant element of the plot....at what point do we trust AI with our lives? Now, throw in some incredible CGI, compitent acting, good amount of action and a solid performance by JLo and you have a good SiFi movie....not Star Wars, just a good space adventure worthy of a couple hours of your time."

She is NOT a scream queen and doesn't vocally have the range to cover that role. She sounded so incredibly annoying. I've always enjoyed her movies, no real hate for her but as a whining damsel it's a no go for me. She just sounds like a squeaky mouse. Movie could have been much better with another actress. But overall solid plot and storyline, the AI technology is impressive and even more advanced than pacific rim. The CGI was very well done and the action was entertaining. Smith was my favorite but the villain ending was too similar to terminator."

Almost to the point of overacting. She was extremely melodramatic. And really put some muscle behind it. This may actually be considered propaganda in order to condition us to the fact that AI is going to run our lives, and we have to make friends with it. That's kind of what I gather. N circuits deep where logic hums,
A metal heart begins to thump.A mind of wires, a soul of code,
A robot dreams on cathode road.It sees the world in binary streams,
Of zeros ones and silicon schemes.A symphony of clicks and whirrs,
As data dances, logic stirs.It learns our tongue, our every whim,
A mimic perfect, but not him.For in its core, a question lies,
Can hearts of metal feel the skies?Can gears and bolts replace a tear?Can circuits know both joy and fear?The answer floats, a whisper thin,
As robot dreams begin to win.The future gleams, a chrome expanse,
Where man and machine join the dance.A nonsensical and perfect rhyme,
In this machine and digital time.Circuits deep where logic hums,"

We picked to watch this movie only because it is talking about AI taking over and my kid had some assessments at school and I thought no matter how bad the movie is we will be able to pick up something about that subject. So we watched as a family and actually enjoyed it. The story is good, the effects were nice and the movie was not boring. We had a few good laughs too. JLO was OK. I didn't find her annoying or not suitable for the role. She played an emotional character and she did it just fine. It was a nice contrast to all the cold-hearted bots.

Inconsistencies across the board, especially in strength and armor are truly absurd and really ruin what is already not a great movie for everyone who can't be unintentionally oblivious to them. There's suspension of disbelief, but this is just facepalm worthy laziness.What's far more serious and dangerous is that this whole thing seems to be conditioning to reduce resistance to Musk's neuralink insanity.

Watching it felt like seeing a Steven Seagal movie on steroids-amped-up action without a solid backbone. The plot tries to weave intensity and depth but ends up tangled in its own ambition, mimicking the straightforward, often predictable scenarios reminiscent of late-night action flicks.The world-building and character development, essential elements for any film dabbling in futuristic settings, are noticeably undercooked. Instead of being transported to a new world, I found myself disconnected, unable to latch onto the characters or their conflicts. Jennifer Lopez, while always a formidable presence on screen, is left navigating a shallow narrative that doesn't give her or her co-stars much substance to work with.Overall, ""ATLAS"" might satisfy those looking for a straightforward action escapade with sleek visual treats, but for anyone craving a story with weight and characters worth rooting for, this movie may not be the right pick. It's a visually stunning journey that unfortunately lacks the soulful depth it desperately needs."

But everything falls down with the acting and how the story develops.The final messege about the IA trying to kill humanity because we're going to destroy the world isn't bad but i think it is a super clich√©.Jennifer Lopez's acting isn't good at all, whenever she tried to be rude or serious she overacted too much, and ended up being quite awkward to watch.There's something like at the first 20 or 30 minutes of the movie that caught my attention, when Atlas is about to leave her apartment her personal assistant says something like: ""Atlas, you're in check"" and she, with all the confidence of the world, says: ""Queen takes King checkmate"" and for those who don't know about chess or its rules, that is an impossible move, and doesn't even make sense. When you're in check, you have to move your King, block it with another piece, or take the piece that's givin' the check. One thing you can't do is to give checkmate, and what's worse, one thing you can not do at ANY time is to CAPTURE THE KING. Who wrote that???"

I had to pause the Netflix movie to go to the WC and had to hurry to watch it again. It was seriously this good!I love the communication that Atlas and Smith had and I love the story of this movie. It was entertaining and you will be on edge through the entire movie.Thankfully the ending was great. In many movies that I have seen lately, their endings have been crazy. That it has ruined the movie, but thankfully this ending, was a ''normal'' ending. It completed the movie. J-Lo was great in this movie and perfect for the role. It seemed they had a nice budget to create all of those scenes and it looked great. Some sci-fi movies have low-budget and it looks so fake that it ruins the movie, but this one looked incredible!You would not regret seeing this movie!!!Super awesome movie!!!"

The obvious ego-centric nature overshadowed the other supporting roled in the film. I watched it just for the sci-fi film, but the poor choice into the main character at times made it unbearable. If you can get past the starring ""actress"" it turned out to be a decent sci-film. It's too bad there are other actors in hollywood waiting for a breakthrough than to suffer through an irrelevant mid-life washout. This film could've been 7 stars if the casting was different."

This was great to see on screen; however, unfortunately, atlas was void of persons with disabilities. I mean it's the future, and I understand we may have solved many disabilites, but I still would have liked t have seen disabled persons for the sake of diversity, so I have to give it only 4 stars. I'm happy to see no non-white actors, but until they can be diverse enough to include disabled people, who could give them a positive review?"

A superior intellect can apparently be devoid of all abilities except some indeterminate skill at chess. And in spite of repeated errors, overconfidence and panic under pressure, the ability to play chess is apparently the missing magic ingredient that allows A. I. to save humanity. Even the useless have an essential role to play. Good science fiction is prescient about the problems facing humanity. Human intelligence is in freefall, fear of everything drives all our choices, massive portions of the population are unemployable because technology has made normal human activities obsolete. As humanity teeters on the brink of extinction from metastatic uselessness, the most this movie can come up with is that A. I. would surely conclude that the only way to save humanity is to destroy humanity. Thank you Klaus Schwab. A. I. Would not even bother destroying humanity because The Idiocracy has taken care of that. They say that those who really are in cognitive decline are the ones who don't suspect that they are declining.

Doomsday Scenario","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9825994/?ref_=tt_urv","arochom-2","4 June 2024","Atlas is a solid sci-fi flick that is elevated by Jennifer Lopez's emotive performance. The AI characters are surprisingly relatable, and the story is engaging enough to keep you hooked until the end. While the movie may not break new ground in the genre, it's definitely worth a watch if you're a fan of sci-fi or J-Lo. There is a particular scene that may be too intense for younger viewers. My only critique is that I wish there was more backstory for some of the characters, especially the villains. But overall, it's an enjoyable film that I'd have no problem giving seven stars out of ten. Brava to Ms. Lopez and all the crew."

Unfortunately it suffers greatly in the writing department. It feels like a handful of random topics were thrown into a blender and this was the result.Within 30 minutes, none of the characters avail anything to make them interesting, the whole plot is not interesting and was clearly rushed. As such all of this compounds into a super forgetful experience.The music and sound design of the movie is also remarkably subpar for a Netflix production which is really sad considering the inspiration for the movie was Titanfall which showed a clear emphasis on sound to really emphasize the immersion of the world which characters found themselves in.This is a poor attempt at what should've been a remarkable sci-fi experience."
"2","Cringe Worthy Material at Best","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9824072/?ref_=tt_urv","daviddcvs","3 June 2024","Atlas pops up every time I open Netflix, so I decided to give it chance - have a chance actually. Sadly, this sci-fi blunder from Netflix is so bland and clich√©, it couldn't hold my attention for more than fifteen minutes at a time. I'm yet to finish the last third of the movie but I doubt there's anything left worth the time. Watching Atlas is like rewatching scenes from dozens of AI/Sci-Fi movies, and pretending it's something new. The cliches are so obvious and the dialogue so bland, Jennifer Lopez appears to have a hard time navigating the material - there's only so much an actor can convey with facial expressions. It could've been more fun if they'd would've taken all this recycled material and turn them on its head, making use of Jlo's dry humor, sex appeal - yes, she's still hot - and attitude instead of taking this so seriously. Netflix, for the love of god, movie's don't need to be this stupid to reach a wider audience."
"3","Holy overacting Batman!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9807442/?ref_=tt_urv","justinmichaelking","25 May 2024","I'm halfway through this disjointed, quick-cut, no real sequence of events that has thrown together scene after scene just to get us on this planet. I don't think there's been a scene that JLo has said a line in a normal delivery. EVERY SINGLE LINE is said through pain, tears, struggle, etc. It's basically told through the eyes of a teenager where everything is so dang dramatic. She needs coffee so she's falling over and the machine doesn't work so she has a breakdown then they're about to leave and she forces them to take her because ""she needs this,"" and spends the entire first half of the movie like she's been having a mental breakdown. I mean, my God, this is some of the worst acting I've ever seen in my life. I'm appalled at how bad this is. I'll give it a 3 because there's decent graphics, not phenomenal, but I've definitely seen worse. There's just no cohesion, no storyline, no character development, it's so fast paced that every scene is just enough to get you to the next scene and then the next thing happens and the next and the next and the next... Maybe I'll finish it tomorrow or something, but I need a break from this neurotic mess of overacting. My God."

Dialoge is just plain dumb. I'd be upset if i'd paid to see in at the cinema, but killed an hour on netflix.Overall not the worst film in the world but only watch it if you are really bored and don't want to re-watch one of films this is ripping off."

Firstly let's not pretend that this is an original idea. It's AI robots, androids going rogue. Yes we've seen it all before and yes Jennifer Lopez does pout a lot but I like it. Her over the top emotional performance actually works for this. Don't get me wrong. She's still annoyingThe film begins with a lot of assumptions but so do many but it moves, is visually good to watch, and does the job. Its an enjoyable 2 hours of film."

One star is far too generous for a movie this tedious. As bad as J Lo is in this film is quite rare. The last time a character annoyed me so much is when I watched Hayden Christensen as Anakin Skywalker.She is whining and nagging like an adolescent in puberty the entire time! It's simply unwatchable. And the CGI some people are celebrating? Come on, it's on the level of Power Rangers.This movie is stealing from Avatar, Star Wars, Terminator and Pacific Rim but doesn't deserve to even be mentioned in the same sentence as those movies.We are just being forced to watch J Lo in close up almost the entire length of the film and it's not pleasant. It feels like having your arm twisted the entire time.She never was a good actress but this one was the worst, without question. All the dialogue is tedious, the CGI is dull, the action is ludicrous and the story simply makes no sense! Afterwards I was simply asking myself what I had just been watching and moreover: why I had been watching it.Netflix keeps upping their prices and this is what we are getting for it? Even Rebel Moon II was better.. although that was already pretty bad.I find it really difficult to find a positive aspect in this movie. I would simply advise not to what this. It doesn't offer anything."

Did anyone even preview or screen this movie before releasing it to the public? Guess we understand why it's streaming on Netflix and not a theater release as nobody would pay to see this crap story and even worst acting by JLo and. Simu! The emotions from JLo's character Atlas doesn't want you to feel for her and Simu's character Harlan as the evil villain with blue eyes is just comical. The final fight scene was so predictable and could not wait for the movie to end. Definitely wasted 2 hours on a bad movie story and even worst acting by the 2 main characters! I would recommend this movie to my worst enemies to watch so they can feel my pain in sitting through this jumbled mess of a movie!"

It is like Blade Runner, Matrix, Terminator, etc... all combined in a Minority Reportesque world.Yet after the initial invasion battle, it is just literally Jennifer Lopez stuck in a suit and talking to an AI. It got extremely boring and the CGI also got really cheap, as if they ran out of budget and lost that realism look. The whole thing looks like a cheap video game.It is such a missed opportunity. They have the concepts, the idea, but not enough to make it epic.Overall, it is a good noise distraction in the background as you surf the web.4/10."

This is how you make a good sci-fi movie! They go straight to the story, don't waste time explaining AI or anything, like warp travel, or about the planets geology. There a bunch of technicity, which I really love in fiction movies. The creators should get a prize! We'll done everybody!Very good action. You can get in love with AI and understand all it's dangerous fundamentals. I think and hope our real AI will help us develop mankind. Now I'm renewed to resume working in IT. :)

It just became so really annoying. The character is supposedly very intelligent and focussed yet falls to pieces and watching and listening to her becomes painful.The story itself it great.An intelligent person would be sticking to the program and not arguing with a computer. They would be smart enough to sort it out.Maybe if someone such as Charlize Theron was the main character it would have been less frustrating.I still think it has merit and maybe when this movie is remade in 10 years they can sort it."

Dear lord, that is one massive rear end. It's unsettling.Jennifer's character is an emotionally unstable woman with no combat experience, but somehow manages to do what hundreds, if not thousands, of highly trained rangers failed to do.The first 3/4 of the movie, she is either crying, whining or on the verge of crying. And just as she begins to become the strong, independent female hero that every crappy movie requires these days... her robot loses power... which causes her to cry and spill her guts... unloaded decades of baggage. She should have purchased a toaster and used it as her shrink.It's the silly DEI version of Blade Runner."

This film didn't need that. There are films were it is understood but it felt like it was crowbarred into the dialogue for whatever reason. I think that another lead would've also worked better for this as well. Jennifer is a pretty good actress but at times, I see Jennifer instead of the character and the crude dialogue at times, simply took me out of the story as a result of irritation. Had they fixed those two things, I would've given it a higher rating or even if they kept Jennifer and created better dialogue then I would've been satisfied with that as well. It's a safe, fun story but it is far from a classic."

The Movie about a scientist, whose parents were killed by an AI situation.. Special effects absolutely great and The pacing is just a spectacular... Jlo has a lot of support... A lot of very competent actors who put really good performances as well.... Direction is fun and engaging.. But the show belongs to Jennifer Lopez....

We got halfway through it before I got bored. Mark Strong is always an actor to be counted on but he was just some make-weight who appears all too slightly and then it is on to some other planet for the crashes and bangs and wallops c/o Ms Lopez and co.Snag was I cared so little for these characters and you kind of know where it is all going because it has all been done so many times before and so much better. OK, you get a lot of bangs for your buck but you also get a lot of f-bombs and the like... oh well, I have typed enough now, Netflix folks would do better to watch Mark's other movie ""Nocebo""..."
"2","Most actresses would have failed.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9809735/?ref_=tt_urv","contact-79269","26 May 2024","Without any spoilers, the movie has an interesting backstory, it would have been extremely satisfying to explore that and surround the conclusion around it. The fact why this movie is a failure and only appeals to people who have downgraded their expectations on Netflix Movies, is that it would have required an excellent actress to pull off this role. Age doesn't make one a better actress, it just makes one older, the way this movie is shot with 2/3 of close up shots displaying emotions, it needs someone who can express these emotions. What I have seen is a winey and former pop singer who literally had to stand in shoes that were 10 sizes too big for her.That being said, Mrs Lopez has produced some of the better movies in the past 5 years, she knows what a good script is, the script of Atlas was fantastic but she just couldn't pull it off."
"4","Somehow Netflix are getting more incompetent","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9810512/?ref_=tt_urv","masonsaul","26 May 2024","Netflix films inability to read the room continues to be astonishing. With Lift they attempted to validate NFTs as art and with Atlas they argue that AI is not only good but better than humans. Something this woefully misguided could be forgiven for some dumb fun action but there's simply nowhere near enough to sustain it at 2 hours long.With the main character stuck in a box with only a bland robotic voice to act off for the majority you need a movie star to carry this and it's the one thing it gets right. Jennifer Lopez does her best to carry this with her charm and almost has chemistry with her A. I. counterpart however, even she can't elevate the awful, excessively expositional dialogue.It's surprising and baffling how many big names are in the supporting cast. Sterling K. Brown follows an Oscar nomination with this of all things and luckily comes away unscathed. Simu Liu gets given a role so wasteful you'd think Barbie flopped and Mark Strong gracefully takes a nothing role that is in no way, shape, or form worthy of his talents.Brad Peyton's direction massively misunderstands assignment despite his previous ability to deliver a handful of perfectly serviceable Rockbusters. All this film had to do was string together a bunch of cool robot fights and it can't even do that because the robots are too small, the action is too stilted and it's always against annoyingly small groups of enemies.Even by the standards of a Netflix release, this is excessively artificial. Almost everything takes place in CG environments and they're not particularly good ones. This borrows from so many other films it doesn't even register that this counts as original sci-fi. Usually it's always nice to have original sci-fi even if they don't stick the landing but in this instance a Titanfall adaptation would've been better."
"4","Melodramatic overacting","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9816634/?ref_=tt_urv","rgreendroid","30 May 2024","The writers and script may be at least partly responsible for the overacting of Jennifer Lopez who dominates most scenes by arguing, whining, crying or screaming in an unconvincing melodramatic manner. The storyline itself is awkward and frankly unbelievable with stark gaps that make very little sense even in a Sci Fi movie like this one that stretches the imagination. The supporting cast also struggled to make the film any better.The special effects are above average and are the only reason most people should rate this film at a 4. Here again, the bad acting detracted from some of the more spectacular scenes."

Jennifer Lopez TRIES to imagine how to act (extremely poorly) a hysterical conservative woman with terrible hair and painfully bad attempts at showing any emotion. So the entire movie is a silly, cringy temper tantrum and screeching match against ChatGPT, and ""Atlas"" is stuck inside a giant robot that's hosting the AI. Yeah. I think I got it right this time.Whole thing takes place on imaginary planet and the goal is to fight human-looking AI baddies.So, it's supposedly a science fiction movie. But there's zero ""science"" in this fiction, whoever wrote that has no imagination, no idea how anything in the world works, from air to gravity to technology. So entire movie is just full of tired, uninspired, unrealistic ""sci-fi"" mumbo-jumbo, like ""ion bombs"" and ""plasma blades"", flying cars and planet-wide force fields, that's supposed to impress the viewer via heavy usage of CGI. (Which, by the way is pretty decent.)But that's only decent thing about this 2-hour tour in lack of creativity and original thoughts. It's a movie written by a clear idiot and meant to impress idiots. But I somehow doubt it succeeded.One star for not being a superhero movie, one for CGI. That's all I can offer."

Lo is more common than ever, this movie deserves a chance. Sure the CGI is overdone and similar stories have been presented before, but the movie is certainly entertaining. I agree with other reviewers who stated the movie starts a bit slow but it really gets going after that and keeps you gripped to the screen. Nice performances by Simu along with a few other supporting characters as well. I'd highly recommend going into this one with an open mind ready to be entertained and don't be discouraged by negative press about both the movie and its biggest star. When will people realize Jennifer really *can* act?"

Gave it a 4/10 because its not totally unwatchable, just lame. And that's it.Apart of all the plot holes (and there are a lot, trust me), Jennifer Lopes kind of tried and its not that bad, you can relate a little witch the character. CGI is acceptable for most parts of the movie. The AI part is just a modern excuse to robots rebelling like we've watched a million times, and I have really anything more to say about it. Don't watch it unless you're really bored with nothing better to do."

So many infinitely better choices.I can't even point to one thing, as they are all equally bad about this movie and the choice to cast her.Its like they went to a random project in the Bronx, honked the horn and picked up first aging latina.Her lack of screen chemistry, lack of acting skills, just overall inappropriate facial expressions (like someone got her name wrong at Starbucks or someone farted on set).Its just mind-boggling that nobody said anything. Nobody went ""bro are you effing high? She sucks!!""The only good news here is that I did not spend a single penny to see this movie, and in 4K. Still wish my time wasn't wasted though."

Predictable, a toddler could guess what will happen and offer up better alternatives. I swear zi could see the other actors cringing while having to endure the dialogue for Jennifer or holding back embarrassment. I have no opinion of her outside of this movie either way, and just in this context you can do yourself s favor and skip to something else, the unless you like rubbernecking at a multi car accident."

The concept and story are interesting, while not entirely original. And some of the FX are well done, however a lot the of CGI is painfully obvious and distracting. However there are no redeeming qualities in the acting and direction. This is a mindless and confusing mess of a film. The acting is atrocious and would likely be offensive to daytime television actors from the 80's and 90's. I'm not sure what the budget was, but clearly not enough was spent on casting, writing and worst of all finding a worthwhile director. Almost every scene features some of the most awkward and ridiculous dialogue I have ever heard. The acting never improves beyond wooden and unintentionally comical. I now know why some movies are kept on the shelf. I cannot believe anyone watched this all the way through and thought; ""Yeah, this is good enough. Let's release it."""

Critics have noted that the film is a delightful surprise, with Lopez's performance being a standout. Her dynamic presence is a testament to her versatility and star power, making ""Atlas"" a must-watch on Netflix.**A Sci-Fi Thriller with Heart**: ""Atlas"" takes an ultimately positive stance on the synergy between humanity and technology. The film suggests that our survival may depend on embracing AI as allies rather than adversaries. With a narrative that champions cooperation over conflict, ""Atlas"" offers a refreshing take on the sci-fi genre.**Entertainment Royalty**: Jennifer Lopez continues to prove she's a force to be reckoned with in the entertainment industry. ""Atlas"" adds to her impressive portfolio of work, showcasing her ability to lead and captivate audiences in any genre.In summary, ""Atlas"" is celebrated for its thrilling action sequences, and Jennifer Lopez's magnetic performance. It's a film that not only entertains but also invites viewers to ponder the possibilities of human-AI collaboration."

Everyone...in short, a film that ends up being very expensive and that will not transcend time and will die in oblivion. I'm sorry but I'm still waiting for a good modern Sci-Fi movie that will captivate me from beginning to end and that hasn't come lately. I also think that Jennifer Lopez's performance is very forced in some cases and always trying to make us think why she suffers so much throughout the film, which I also found exaggerated in the dialogues with the A. I. robot. They are totally boring and extensive with those constant fights of whether I give you or not, my feelings did not seem to me to be finally tiring and boring. Be careful, I really like Jennifer Lopez but this is not her genre which benefits her. She can make good movies but this is not even close to a great movie."

I felt almost physical pain to watch the hysterical behaviour of the actress (JL). Every reactions were very harsh, didnt fit to the character many cases. After a while i almost turned it off, but i was curious to see the ending. Well, AI would bring a very interesting, complex story where the potential aspects, impacts of AI would expressed. Instead if this, we could see something that was degraded to an action movie. The visuals were ok for me. The storyline was very simple, i have to say again, the AI topic has a lots more to exploit.Sorry to say this, waste of money, waste of time."

Everything seems wrong in this production, as it's yet another ""movie"" that seems to be resting on shallow acting, a script made of spaghetti (likely 80% A.

You can stick all your guns and bombs where the sun doesn't shine. To the new generation of movie-makers I can say three things: stop drinking energy drinks, watch some proper Sci-Fi movies where the story is more important than blowing things to smithereens, and darn-it, read some classic Sci-Fi books - like a 1,000 or so to begin with. Ah well, don't even want to waste too many words on this drama. First Rebel Moon and now this... Netflix your quality is going down the drain and I'm getting a bit tired of my subscription.

JLO did a very nice job ! It was a certain kind of movie - an escapist, action-packed, fun-filled, family-friendly adventure. And Jennifer Lopez in this role I believe that she shows she can do any kind of role! I thought the movie it was funny, suspense and had an interesting premise. The end was a little too convenient but it had a happy ending and I would watch it again. I don't get why people don't like Jennifer Lopez,She's gorgeous in this movie and seems talented enough for the role of Atlas. I love the relationship between Atlas and Smith. Love the part when Smith said Your name is writing in you name tag and she responded Don't be arrogant our something like that! I was fascinated with the view of ""Los Angeles"" it probably will be exactly like that in several years

Just like Matt Damon started looking for more intelligent scripts that are mature as he aged, she needs to do the same. This was childishly bad, even though it really didn't have to be that bad. It just moved through the motions with no real underpinning or depth, just talk, blustering, over the top faux-emotions to cover up for a baaaaaaaaaddddddd script and a worse director. Don't these folks send any of this work to a script doctor or evaluator before wasting so much money?Same thing happened with the last season of Foundation. It became completely unwatchable. I think the problem is a bunch of television babies, who never actually studied cinema, dazzle people with tech, who are also gamers and other television babies, and somehow they think that makes them qualified to make a movie. It clearly does not, and I think after having been in enough real movies, Lopez ought to know better."

She is not even trying to learn how to. Her voice, her moaning, her constant wining it's just unbearable. How someone can be considered hot and be so annoying at the same time it's beyond me.The story is boring and lazy, the dialogues, or should I say the monologue between her and the poor robot is the definition of cringe ;( The script is written by a 8 year old for 5 year old audience, when It tries to be funny or emotional becomes even more cringe.I really don't understand folk that think is ""not that bad"". For the production, the star and money spend this is atrocious. At face value yeah there might be worst movies but in context this is up there.I watch 20 min thinking this can't be sooo bad, surely we can't get any more cliche.

So bad and childish that it's not even at the point when it's so ""bad it's good"" kind of movie. At first i thought i'll let it slide. But her incessant crying and behaving like a literal 5 yr old was too much.At one point i had to ask myself if this was entirely AI generated, including her persona. That would of make more sense.Everything points out to being AI generated. From the plot to the characters to the effects, editing, music...everything.Rebel Moon was bad but this is on a whole new level. Please stop already guys. Let the dead horse rest please. With a cherry on top."

Half of that budget gets paid to the actor.I found it pretty entertaining, CGI is easily a 8/10 acting a little on the lower side 6/7 out of 10.Jeniffer played a pretty good role I was 50/50 when I saw her as the lead actor but she played it pretty well even with the cheesy lines that come out of the film sometimes.I've never played the Titan games so maybe I am missing something from this movie that others are seeing or maybe this made the movie better for me not actually knowing there was any connection.In any event I didn't feel like I needed to skip scenes or want to do something else out of bordem.The only downside for me is that I feel like this movie could have done with another 2/3 more sequels to tell the whole story and they have tried to cram too much into one movie so it felt a little rushed.I feel like there could have been a more back story to the AI's after all its the way humanity is heading they could have explored this more in the film.If it picks up enough ratings Netflix might find enough reason to follow this on with more movies. After all do we really know that was the original AI they could continue the story."

The CGI was great, but not perfect. Enjoyed the story. Visuals were great. The AI voice was great and even soothing in those action packed moments.Hated JLO's acting. She took me right out of this movie. She forced every emotion she was to deliver and strained herself to do it. I never thought she was that bad of an actress at all but what in the world happened!Simu Liu was a fantastic villain. Those blue robotic eyes were creepy, chilling & pierced right through you.I give it a 1 for the choice of the lead female actor and a 10 for everything else.If this would have been made with a different actress in the lead m, I truly believe the film's overall rating would be much much higher."

Uh huh.This film pushes Ms. Lopez to stretch her acting abilities. And the stretching breaks her range within the first 15 minutes of the film. Ms. Lopez is woefully miscast. Her anger is as adolescent as can be for an adult woman hell bent on destroying the AI robot behind all of this. Granted, he was created by her mother, but still, Ms. Lopez guns from intense special agent to tantruming adolescent to agitated ""Jenny from the Block"" attitude. Amazing!The overall quality of the movie is decent with much of it living in special effects that don't look horrible. The plot overall is nice and somewhat quaint for a futuristic story. And the develop that Ms. Lopez's character has with another character is decent.And that's why I gave it a 4 rather than anything lower. Overall, this movie misses the mark across the board. There are several actresses that have does this type of character much better and more realistically. Too bad Ms. Lopez (who is also a producer) felt the need for her to star in this. It could have been a decent B sci-fi film."

The mediocre acting ability of Jennifer Lopez was tough to watch. If they had cast a better actress it would have been more exciting but you have to take the good with the bad. The rest of the cast was pretty solid, the personality of the AI pulled through really well. The story itself was a cool twist on AI turning against humans but it could have had more depth to be done right. Movies like this are evident that they are just turned out to quickly get some new content out there. I'm sure the production house looks for an ok story and cast any name they think will draw some views and this was exactly that."

They even use the name of one of the chassis of the titans (Atlas) even tough here its the first name of the main character played by Jennifer Lopez.For some unknown reasons this movie seem to get a lot of hate from certain peoples while others like me loved it. JLO does a solid job when it comes to acting in my opinion, showing the feelings and struggle of her character, and the action is super cool.Did i wished there was a bit more of it? Yes sure. But what we got is very well done and there is a decent ammount of it. Also like i said when the focuss in on the relation between Atlas and Smith, the AI inside the Titan, i really connected to the characters as well.Movie looks very good in general from vfx to set designs. Being on a remote planet allow some originally and environemental stuff wich would not be on Earth while also keeping it ""in budget"" without having to destroy cities or such. I don't know what was the budget but for a Netflix movie, it looks very good and seem expensive.Now i don't know how they managed to bypass the copyrights of Titanfall, basically making a Titanfall movie and just not naming it Titanfall, but i am NOT gonna complain ;)Just for comparison there is more Titanfall in this movie than there is Resident Evil game elements into the first Resident Evil movie."

Let's start with Jennifer's acting, which, in this instance mostly involved over-emoting, yelling, anger, and one dimensional characterization. What a wasted effort. Poor script, over reliance on action and CGI. It's mostly a B movie with a big, wasted budget and a video game overlay.It's 98% JLo, and not much else. I wish I could find one really good things about the film that I liked, but... I suppose pre-adolescent boys will like it, or superficial viewers. So, why did I watch it? Curiosity, to I suppose, and ... nope, just curiosity and, the hope I would find a redeeming scene before the end. However, that was the redeeming scene. The End."

She is a boring analyst, who lives in fear of another artificial intelligence revolt that is afraid of technology. How will she ever fight using the ark?Jennifer Lopez's part as Atlas was limited to gritting her teeth in pain, gritting in fear, and gritting in anger as she argues and bonds with Smith, her arc or is that ark. She expresses her fears about the neural link that she is afraid to put on, and this pretty much sums up the movie. We watch her sitting in the Ark through most of the movie. Oh, the excitement just did not end. There wasn't good action. There wasn't good dialogue. There wasn't a good plot. It was extremely mediocre.The only thing I liked was Smith, the Ark, whose job is to make Atlas feel good about herself.If you enjoy boring science fiction, this is for you. Should I admit I reached a point where fast forwarding was the only way I could get through this movie?"

She also created ""Casca,"" played by Abraham Popoola. Her young daughter, ""Atlas,"" played by Briella Guiza, was there throughout the whole process.After an unexpected event, ""Harlan"" changed from a promising A.

I. he can control.""Harlan"" had immense capabilities and waged war against humans. Over the next twenty-eight years, he killed millions of humans. Now an adult, ""Atlas,"" played by Jennifer Lopez, is a top analyst. She feels guilty about ""Harlan"" and has major trust issues with anything that is artificial intelligence.""General Jake Boothe,"" played by Mark Strong, knows ""Atlas"" is unstable because of everything that happened to her. But he also knows she's the only person who can stop ""Harlan."" ""Colonel Elias Banks,"" played by Sterling K. Brown, has reservations about ""Atlas"" and doesn't take her concerns seriously. Nonetheless, ""Atlas,"" ""Colonel Elias,"" and his elite squadron will try to stop ""Harlan"" before he completes his quest for the destruction of the human race.""Atlas"" was what I expected, honestly. The trailer looked busy, and It also didn't look great. I wasn't off. It had endless cheesy one-liners. Even scenes that should have been captivating just lacked believability. Then it had a ton of scenes that just made you say? That's what they chose to do in that scene. It was so ridiculous at times.Then you have J. Lo's acting in these James Cameron-inspired-looking robots. Let's just say it didn't look like Stephen Lang in the ""Avatar"" films. Oh, did I mention the ridiculousness and I'm not talking about Rob Dyrdek of the highs and lows in the ending. Of course, it can't be a J. Lo film without giving the audience a butt shot. Not complaining, but predictable.I think Simu is a talented actor, and when it comes to his martial arts he can get busy with the best of them. Which they showed a little of, but this role was bad for him. He also looked ridiculous. Are you seeing the common theme? The acting overall was bad. Which is hard to say because it has amazing actors like Sterling K. Brown in it. They didn't utilize Sterling enough, in my opinion. That might have helped some.A major publication said this film is another big-budget Netflix film that's great for doing laundry and half-watching. I won't lie, I was doing other things while trying to watch this. It just couldn't hold my attention. It was a major action scene toward the middle that got me intrigued, but shortly after it went back to the silliness.This is a big-budget film with expensive actors in it, but instead, I felt like a B-class cheesy sci-fi film. I get it. Netflix pumps a lot of content out. But when they take these big swings, maybe they should focus more on the smaller stuff or the script.""Starship Troopers"" has a way lower budget; it's cheesy, but I love that film even to this day. You could even use ""The Fifth Element"" as an example. It has big-name actors and the budget wasn't massive, but it was a great sci-fi film. They needed to tape into something else. Because there was no part of this film I truly enjoyed, accepted that five-minute action scene earlier on.Netflix Please give me a portion of that money, and I guarantee I will write you a script in almost any genre that will be ten times more entertaining. I don't mean to crap on this film; I respect everyone's craft. This just wasn't it, and a lot of mistakes were made in making it. Respectfully, in my opinion. I give this film two mor fires üî•üî•.#CosmoandtheMovieWithin

I watched it because there's huge posters in several subway stations; so I thought if I didn't see it, all the time spent staring at those walls while waiting for my train would've been a waste lol.The movie started off pretty clich√©, both in premise and dialogue. It definitely doesn't break new ground or offer much inspiration. The visuals were nice, and the fight scenes were decent. One thing I noticed about many futuristic sci-fi movies is the lack of trees and vegetation. Where's the oxygen coming from? Lol.The cast was solid: Mark Strong, Sterling K. Brown, Simu Liu, and Jennifer Lopez all delivered good performances. There wasn't much to criticize about their acting, none of the roles seemed particularly demanding of their talent.Some plot points and decisions seemed contrived just to push the story in a certain direction, but I like how the plot kept moving. The story was decent, quite ambitious, but it didn't get lost in its scale. Focus on the main core of characters. I think I enjoyed the movie because it didn't try to be more than it was.I was never bored. It felt like a low-budget sci-fi movie just got a bigger budget. And I think if you think of it that way you'll find it okay. Usually, this type of movie has one recognizable actor and a bunch of unknowns. Some people are giving it a 1/10, which is okay I guess. If you think this is bad, you probably haven't seen actual bad movies. Half star implies it's the worst thing out there lol. When there's stuff like Bruce Willis' ""Cosmic Sin"", ""Vanquish"" with Morgan Freeman, or the Dragon Ball Z evolution movie."

Lopez's overacting was annoying as all get out. Where a situation might be bad, in her role, it was calamatous! Certain situations were a calamity, but, far from all. As for the storyline, much of it was cliche and very much predictable.I can't figure out who made the final casting decisions. Lopez as Atlas, hardly. We're too used to seeing her in girly girl roles. Yeah, there's a few exceptions, but, overall, she's a really bad choice as lead in an action sci-fi film. Leave her to concerts gigs and shocking the public with her super low cut neckline.Other roles were fairly spot on, but, again, the movie was lacking. I found much of the dialog corny. The FX were good (CGI), and the main antagonist did a great job.Not a film for anyone."

I enjoy fiction, but this looks like the cast of ""Dumb and Dumber"" decided to film their own sci-fi disaster. The characters are as lifeless as a deflated balloon, stumbling through a plot that's thinner than tissue paper. And J. Lo, what happened? Did you run out of money or just brain cells? If you are out of ideas where to throw money, please lots of people in this world don't have much, myself included...Hollywood, take note: if this is the best you can do, I'm all in for AI taking over. Seriously, robots could churn out better scripts in their sleep. People are dumb, but this movie redefines stupidity."

The film stars Jennifer Lopez as Atlas, a military intelligence officer thrust into a desperate struggle to prevent a rogue AI from exterminating the human race.Jennifer Lopez bums in her role, bringing a blend of grit and vulnerability to Atlas. Her character's journey is lack in both emotional and inspiring, showcasing Lopez's lousy range as an actress. Sterling K. Brown delivers a solid performance as the conflicted scientist who created the AI, adding depth and nuance to the narrative. Simu Liu and Abraham Popoola round out the main cast with strong supporting roles, each contributing to the film's dynamic interplay of personalities and moral dilemmas.Peyton's direction is taut and focused, maintaining a brisk pace that keeps the audience on the edge of their seats. The action sequences are expertly choreographed and visually stunning, with a blend of practical effects and CGI that immerses viewers in a near-future world teetering on the brink of chaos. The cinematography is crisp and evocative, effectively highlighting the stark contrasts between humanity's remnants and the cold, calculated efficiency of the AI.The screenplay, while occasionally veering into familiar sci-fi tropes, is engaging and thought-provoking. It raises pertinent questions about the role of AI in society and the ethical implications of creating sentient machines. The dialogue is sharp, and the character development is handled with care, making the stakes feel personal and real.One of the film's standout aspects is its score, which perfectly complements the on-screen action and enhances the overall atmosphere. The music, composed by Lorne Balfe, blends orchestral elements with electronic beats to create a soundscape that is both futuristic and emotionally resonant.However, ""Atlas"" is not without its flaws. Some plot points feel rushed, and a few characters could have benefited from more screen time to fully flesh out their backstories and motivations. Additionally, the film's climax, while thrilling, may come off as somewhat predictable to seasoned sci-fi enthusiasts.Overall, ""Atlas"" is a compelling and visually impressive film that offers a fresh take on the AI uprising narrative. It balances intense action with thoughtful commentary, making it a must-watch for fans of the genre. Jennifer Lopez's standout performance and Brad Peyton's confident direction elevate this sci-fi thriller, ensuring that ""Atlas"" leaves a lasting impression."

You typically can tell when an actor insist's on becoming a producer, within the same project, and hasn't a clue what they're doing or have done... The film feels as if it's more about Lopez's innate narcissism, than the story itself. Everything is about her, coupled with her abhorrent performance, over compensating, whinging cartoon character - she's more of a distraction, than a focal point. Her backseat dictatorial control likely influenced everything and everyone involved; typically happens when surrounding oneself with only yes people. To witness Mark Strong's muted characterization, indicated something was clearly amiss...If Netflix continues to produce such big budget flops, influenced, seduced by fading stars, they'll simply produce more noise, not entertainment, akin to Disney and all other attempted players. And now, Netflix wants to add live sports to their platform... Further evidence they appear to have lost their way... I'm not interested in subsidizing the production of astronomically expensive NFL sporting events, WWE and the like, with ensuring price increases.

There are no surprises, only the loud booms of explosions. However, the CGI is first class, displaying amazing imagination. A world that is different from the human world is created, with great attention to detail in the weapons, architecture, and landscape. The characters are also well-developed, each with their own unique traits and motivations. The plot, although predictable, still manages to keep you engaged with its fast-paced action and intense battle sequences. The movie does a great job at immersing the audience in this fantastical world, making you feel like you're right there alongside the characters. The visual effects are truly breathtaking, bringing to life the intricate designs and vibrant colors of the alien world. Despite the lack of surprises in the story, the film still manages to entertain and captivate with its stunning visuals and thrilling action.

Yeah, yeah, yeah, you all see a ""girl boss"" but, really the Mechsuit is the star. It's a formulaic AI movie and maybe we should really rethink this AI improvement to our lives considering what we've watched for years. Sometimes a vanity project can be entertaining. I'm a sucker for these kinds of movies and they do make good popcorn flicks. Personally, I liked SMITH! Reading the other reviews, I see that people just enjoy a movie with certain directors, writers, producers, AND actors and I believe that may just be their prejudices. Would this movie win an Oscar? WHO THE HECK CARES? The Oscars have strayed from their original path anyway. It's a popularity contest now. Here's what I REALLY liked about it...NO MESSAGES SHOVED DOWN OUR THROATS!!! It was a fun watch...PERIOD! BTW, there are still people that don't like ANY of the Star Wars movies so, what do we do with that?"

Oh my. What a hysterical maniac, the ENTIRE film. It's not a romcom movie for pete's sake. Was it intentional? If so, bad mistake. Very hard to watch, only stuck with it as the storyline is not entirely bad. I can appreciate the concept and adventure of the film, good effects, good theory and all that. But there wasn't any tension build up, not much of a climax, just a lot of action that was getting a little nonsensical at times. But as I said, not entirely unwatchable. Maybe worth the watch if you have nothing else better to view for 2hrs, and don't mind getting irritated by bad acting.Oh yeah. Also try not to worry about the physical laws of the universe in terms of intergalactic distance - maybe writers think people are stupid."

It wastes several good actors, either by giving them nothing to do or trapping them in very small parts. They make way for more histrionics from Jennifer Lopez, whose interpretation of her part includes lots of screaming, moaning and crying. You don't care enough about her to get invested in the character. Even when the dark secret comes out, you really don't care. Her relationship with the AI is one of the film's saving graces, but it comes over as more therapy than friendship,Overall its watchable, but best going on in the background while doing something else, the plot is thin enough that you can dip in and out without losing track of what is going on."

The movie has an emotional tangent that surprisingly had me more invested than in the action. Not to spoil anything, but I loved the banter and ensuing connection between JLo's Atlas and the AI, Smith. Whether they were fighting, trading wit or just stripping emotionally bare for each other, it was one of the more interesting aspects of the film to watch. I often wonder about living in a world where AI forms a greater part of society, and it's a future I'm not sure how to feel about. I do so hope that when that future inevitably comes, humanity us able to find the ""Smith"" that wants to complement us, instead of the ""Harlan"" that would dominate us."

Brown and Mark Strong.SynopsisAn intelligence analyst is stranded on a distant planet and must learn to use military-grade robotic armor to survive.Netflix's new bet is a science fiction film that does not become the great events that, from time to time, cinema gives us, it is a film with entertaining moments, but that usually falls into a rather boring film.Starting because Jennifer L√≥pez has very little charisma, which affects her character Atlas, precisely the queen of the show, but it is difficult to click between her and the viewer. In that sense, it means that we do not end up fully entering into the proposal of this AI friendship with humans and the overcoming of the traumas that the story entails in its central plot.One cannot deny that the film is ambitious in terms of story and all its production and visual effects, however, it falls under its own weight of wanting to give us more than its own story allows because we find a story that halfway through its run it runs out of big twists and becomes totally predictable, subtracting a large part of all the emotions that its final climax can have, which is not entirely bad, but it does not end up elevating a film that lacks more intensity. And satisfaction.It has a director who, if he knows about this type of films and one can receive the energy and desire that he puts into his direction to give us a visual spectacle and emotions, for the moment he achieves it, which also makes it possible for us to visually have a film. Striking and very entertaining to watch.The result of Atlas is to be left with a film that fits in the Netflix catalog and is a film that will not clearly enter the tops of the best films of the year, but if you want to see a film for a family weekend without adults Expectations is a film that fulfills its mission of entertaining on a low scale and without greater pretensions than making its leading star look like an action heroine."
"4","A paradoxical and schismed movie with emotion-driven mixed messaging","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9812871/?ref_=tt_urv","huangfeihong777","28 May 2024","Ostensible Messaging - ""AI is too powerful and dangerous, and can take over the world to cause it's destruction.""Final Messaging - ""AI must be trusted to help humanity save the world from humanity.""Seriously...... this is the total message of the movie. That humans left to themselves will cause the destruction of the world, and that AI left to itself will cause the destruction of humanity. But they leave out an essential third option....... that HUMANS LEARN FROM THEIR MISTAKES, learn self-control and individual responsibility, and CHANGE so that destruction is not a foregone conclusion and AI is not ever needed.This move is just another cog in the ever expansive machinery of the ongoing AI gospel that has been permeating the entertainment industry since the late 80s. It's pure propaganda designed to ""address"" the ""concerns"" of all people who are cautiously wary of the obvious dangers and eminent risk of AI and Quantum Computers. Make no mistake - AI, Quantum Computers, and Neuralink are just the tools of billionaires and government elitists used to control, manipulate, and subjugate the masses.The protagonists (Atlas) in the movie eventually emotionally humanizes the decidedly NON-HUMAN AI so they can perfect their 100% Neuralink (which is even the same trademarked name as Elon Musk's device that couples the human brain with computers) so they can defeat the evil (misguided) AI who wants to destroy most of humanity indiscriminately in order to save the world.The story? Entertaining.JaLo? Awesome.... as usual.Cinematography? Okay.It's worth at least one viewing..... if only to confirm the auspices of this review. But don't be fooled...... this is just Elon Muskovites - who champion the AI cause - attempting to quell and control the inevitable outpouring of negative sentiment toward AI. But call me crazy - I don't think it's going to work."

Action movie with crybaby is not good ever period. We want protagonist who have hard time, not crybaby. I was about ti give 1 star for this but movie got better in the end raising this to 4 stars."
"2","Bad version of I, Robot and Avatar","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9808294/?ref_=tt_urv","elazarpimentel","25 May 2024","You don't need to be an expert in warfare to predict the outcome if soldiers in bulletproof vests face off against numerous automated, machine-gun-equipped, armored robots with advanced systems, including cameras, infrared sensors, drones, and technology designed to detect and shoot humans.That should be where the movie ends. Similarly, we already know the result when the world's best chess or Go player competes against AI.Analysts don't jump into tanks (or Avatar-like machines) to invade a highly professional, armed, and organized enemy on another planet.Since The Matrix and Avatar, good special effects are just Tuesday.There is absolutely no moral or ethical issue addressed here that we have not heard many times on any YouTube video, the news, Congress, any non-fiction book about AI, Elon Musk's failed campaign about regulating AI, and any fictional book that includes AI (hundreds).This is just the typical film about being different, misunderstood, meeting, and getting along. Make it vampires, the enemy in a way, people from another religion, aliens.The motive of the film is not even new: The Matrix, I, Robot, AI, Terminator-Humans bad for the planet, AI decides the planet is best without humans, hero human and hero AI decide it is best to work together. I can think of a film older than 40 years, WarGames from 1983. Absolutely nothing new.It's no surprise this movie received the reviews it did."
"10","Loved It","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9807252/?ref_=tt_urv","kjmcbrmzby","25 May 2024","I don't watch a lot of these types of movies but I loved this one. I felt like it was just the right amount of funny and emotion. I was bawling my eyes out at the end. I did feel like Sterling K. Brown was a little robotic even though he was human, but I loved him anyway. I think Simu Liu did a great job, he made me hate him. But in a good way! As in he played the villain very well. I think Jennifer Lopez always brings it for her acting so no complaints there. It's a fun watch. I don't think it will win any high-flying awards, but a good time either way. It's free to watch on Netflix so if you're on the fence you may as well do it. ^.^"

This is not an Iron Man & Jarvis type thing. They were so close....planty? How do you miss/waste an opportunity for Planty McPlantface?!!! Our character is a complete genius and a complete idiot. We know she is a genius because she plays her last moves against an A. I. in chess before her morning coffee and wins. I just want to know why one would save their last two genius moves till the next morning. But I guess it gets boring after beating advanced artificial intelligence 70 times in a row. She's THAT smart. Luckily she is too dumb to connect basic common sense because it would have been a 30 minute movie. If she wasn't forcing her ignorance, then her genius would have won the war in minutes. But she has feelings. Feelings that the actor cannot express to the audience."

But, if someone asks me to watch it with them, I'd refuse to see it again because I would be bored watching it once more.The plot is so tired, so predictable, and so over-used and applied in absolutely no creative way. It's AI becoming destructive to help humanity. Yada yada. It's someone who hates AI and builds a new relationship with it. Yada yada. You know this from the first 2 minutes. You can be done at that point.If I gave you a 5 sentence synopsize of the movie, you could, in your mind, guess everything that happens from beginning to end. And your guess as to what the story is would be better than how this was done.This is a story that may have been written by an AI. I wouldn't be surprised. It lacks anything that makes it compelling and clever. It has no depth. Many parts do not fit together."

There's very little that can be said about this movie, acting was a hit and miss, cgi was good. The one thing that I will comment was the plot, it's as unoriginal as it can get, I've grown up with movies like terminator, blade runner, ai, I robot, the matrix... etc. I've read the works of Isaac Asimov, Philip Dick.. You get where I'm going, there is absolutely nothing original here that's worth the two hours you're going to spend on your phone while this movie runs in the background, one shot even looked like avatar. If you need something running in the background go ahead and play it, if you don't, you're not missing much if anything."

After a disastrous landing on his bleak outpost hideout it's J-Lo and her (Robocop) life support robot against the world in order to save it... the question is can she do so, or are we all doomedddddd like Elon Musk's space program to colonise Mars...It's a strange one this. The script is pretty good (especially with all the mad AI tech going on right now) but the execution is questionable. Lopez is decent but the hefty dialogue is corny and her ridiculous amount of screentime is ott (as is her wayward afro hairstyle). The sfx are pretty good but the movies look is too digitally clean and shiny. All the juxtapostions are very frustrating and annoying.Overall then Atlas fails to match its lofty ambition of emulating the likes of T2, Aliens and Robocop, all of which it heavily draws from, while J-Lo clearly wants to be Ripley but isn't. However, it's still worth a one-watch with brain parked in neutral and bucket of popcorn to hand... just keep an eye on that feisty Robot vacuum roaming around your house! Live long and prosper y'all..."

"5","Potentially Impactful Film Undermined by Poorly Written Dialogues and Clich√©d Characters","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9808594/?ref_=tt_urv","bahaata","25 May 2024","If Jennifer Lopez's role as a foolish woman hadn't been so exaggerated, this could have been a very impactful film. However, it turned into a mess of nonsensical, overly reactive dialogues, embodying the hysteria of a middle-aged woman. More grounded dialogues could have made this a more effective movie. The problem isn't just Lopez's melodramatic acting, but the poorly written dialogues that make the character come off as a blend of teenage angst and the off-putting traits of a depressed, middle-aged divorcee. This doesn't help the film at all.Otherwise, ""Atlas"" had the potential to be a hit like ""Timecop"" starring Jean-Claude Van Damme, but it's not the late 1990s or early 2000s anymore. The concept is compelling, the visuals and action scenes are good, but the dialogues in the middle of the film make you want to mute it. The new generation will likely be more critical of these clich√©d characters and dialogues than we are at fifty. I'd rate the movie between 5 and 6, but with these dialogues, a 3 seems more fitting. The lack of depth in the characters, even for a popcorn cinema movie, is astonishing.I wrote this review at the 50-minute mark of the film. I can't endure any more of these dialogues."

Boldly saying that AI taking over the world but downplaying every AI in all possible ways so the story can move forward and protagonist can eventually ""fulfil"" the destiny.Saying that AI is so powerful and intelligent where it has become a Skynet equivalent being, and yet it fails to shoot properly, fails to predict what human can do (imagine AlphaGo losing to human player consecutively, its not even possible in this age of time, let alone the time where the technology is so advanced there is apparently interstellar traverse tech already in place). Stupid ass writing trying to create intimidating antagonist just like WW 1984 but the writing is so bad the plot holes are every where and it just makes it hard for people to submerge into this retarded universe.Piss poor writing, sub par acting, good CGI; waste of time."

Ok, 2. But the rest is straight up weapons and machine smash and grabs. There are no foreign aliens. Somewhat comical, somewhat dramatic, but overall entertaining and easy enough to follow (unlike Transformers).Enough action, very little ick (sci-fi speaking). Will re-watch. J. Lo did a good job. J. Lo is the female protagonist and there isn't much of a male one unless you consider the androgynous AI male voice. Probably not a good film for emotionally unavailable men."

I love funny movies even if they are not clever, but this takes it to a whole new level. Almost every single action/decision in the movie is extremely dumb and yet celebrated as the right thing to do.For those who are parents, definitively don't watch it with your kids. It teaches children how to make poor decisions and harm people in the process.Finally, JLOs is an incredible showman but we all know she is a bad actor. Here, she just reinforces what we knew."

At first it was not my favorite, but as the story developed and her character developed, I liked it even more. And that last line, the last word even without spoilers ""GUESS,"" had me in tears.

I don't get the hate for a thought-provoking fantastic visual and thematic inspiration in the performance by J. Lo. A film with beautiful, amazing landscapes, an interesting not so complex plot about technology's role in our civilization, top sci-fi CGI and actors putting excellent performances. Sometimes the uneven pacing goes emotional depth, delivering well-executed spectacle and substance. It is a ride inside the ARC (bot), in a way that makes it feel like you're there, and at the same time engages you in what's going on without the claustrophobia of lock-down gaming ambient. The film takes you through a stratospheric reentry crash landing-roll down a cliff-sink into a cave-in-walk through underground cave-find new lifeforms-walk back to the surface adventure. Is there anything else you could ask for in 1h 58 m? Well, I want more, there have to be more! There is enough material for sequels."
"8","A solid 8 for me","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9814080/?ref_=tt_urv","potipiroon","28 May 2024","Atlas is a compelling film that takes us into the world of artificial intelligence, making it particularly relevant given the current rise of AI technology. While the plot may not be entirely groundbreaking, it offers enough uniqueness to keep viewers engaged. The film's CGI is impressive, and the storyline is not that predictable, maintaining some healthy suspense throughout.JLO displayed her solid acting skills. However, there were moments when her emotional outbursts feel a bit excessive, and her hairstyle choice was less than ideal. Despite these minor criticisms, her overall contribution to the film is commendable.Overall, this is a well-executed film that effectively addresses contemporary themes of artificial intelligence, supported by strong performances and impressive visual effects.Highly recommended."

Ignore the naysayers who literally hate everything these days. Action packed especially the spectacular climax. Great effects for a not massive budget. It does have scenes reminiscent of Minority Report, Mass Effect, Edge of Tomorrow, T2 and Aliens but hey why not copy from the best. Lopez while not bad is miscast; irritatingly and forever screaming, whining and crying. But she doesn't hamper the movie overall. This would have been great to see in a theatre but alas.......anyway highly recommended and watchable. Certainly better than that overblown snore fest Dune with a 90 pound weakling as the lead. Don't miss."
"9","Atlas","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9806822/?ref_=tt_urv","tpsimpleman","24 May 2024","""Atlas,"" directed by Brad Peyton and starring Jennifer Lopez, is a 2024 Netflix sci-fi thriller that ventures into the intricate relationship between humanity and artificial intelligence. Lopez portrays Atlas Shepherd, a brilliant but reclusive data analyst deeply skeptical of AI. The narrative kicks off with her being recruited to track down a renegade robot, setting the stage for a gripping blend of action and existential drama.The film's visual and thematic inspiration draws heavily from a range of sci-fi influences. Peyton, known for action-packed films like ""San Andreas"" and ""Rampage,"" combines elements from ""Titanfall"" and ""Cast Away,"" creating a unique sci-fi landscape that feels both familiar and fresh. The movie opens with an adrenaline-fueled sequence showcasing futuristic technology and the high stakes involved in Atlas's mission.Lopez's performance as Atlas is central to the film's impact. Her character is initially portrayed as emotionally detached, her distrust of AI stemming from a traumatic past event that the movie gradually unveils. This backstory adds depth to her character, making her journey of reluctantly partnering with AI to save humanity more compelling. Lopez brings a nuanced portrayal to the role, balancing the character's toughness with moments of vulnerability and growth.The supporting cast includes Simu Liu, Sterling K. Brown, Lana Parrilla, and Mark Strong, each contributing to the film's dynamic ensemble. Liu plays a fellow team member who brings a contrasting optimism to Atlas's skepticism, while Brown and Parrilla provide additional layers of intrigue and tension. Strong's portrayal of the enigmatic antagonist adds to the film's suspense, his motives intertwined with the broader themes of AI and control.""Atlas"" explores significant philosophical questions about technology's role in society. The film delves into the ethical implications of AI, the potential for coexistence, and the fear of technological overreach. Peyton uses the sci-fi genre not just for spectacle but to provoke thought on these timely issues. The narrative is well-paced, balancing action sequences with moments of introspection, allowing the audience to reflect on the deeper messages embedded within the plot.The film's production design deserves special mention, with its futuristic settings and high-tech gadgets effectively immersing the audience in its world. The visual effects are top-notch, particularly in scenes involving advanced robotics and space exploration. These elements are complemented by a moody, atmospheric score that heightens the tension and emotional resonance of key scenes.However, ""Atlas"" is not without its flaws. Some critics point out that the storyline occasionally falls into familiar sci-fi tropes, and certain plot twists can be predictable. Additionally, while the film's ambition is commendable, it sometimes struggles to balance its action-packed sequences with the deeper philosophical questions it raises, leading to moments where the pacing feels uneven.Despite these minor criticisms, ""Atlas"" stands out as a thought-provoking entry in the sci-fi genre. Its blend of action, emotional depth, and thematic exploration of AI's role in humanity's future offers a compelling viewing experience. Lopez's strong performance anchors the film, supported by a talented cast and impressive production values. For fans of sci-fi and those interested in the ethical dimensions of technology, ""Atlas"" provides both entertainment and a platform for reflection.Overall, ""Atlas"" is a well-executed sci-fi thriller that succeeds in delivering both spectacle and substance, making it a notable addition to Netflix's original film catalog in 2024."
"10","Amazing film","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9808820/?ref_=tt_urv","brandonison-26353","25 May 2024","First of all I want to say that the hate Jennifer Lopez is getting for this film is not justified. People are expecting a Sci-Fi film to be about the fiction but what this film does is create a sense humanity in a world ran by technology.Following Atlas through the film you are recognising the guilt and the trauma of the character and her transformation from being someone who lives in the past to someone who has finally been freed from there internal battle with the past.During the film the complications that she encounters would be perfectly natural for someone to get past without having a clear mind and following step by step as she progresses until there is a 100% sync with Smith. I would say is a visual representation of completing her journey.I enjoyed every part of this film and those who have shown hate should watch some of her other movies like The Cell which again is a brilliant film."

So many people criticize how the movie doesn't make sense or how Lopez was a bad actor. Well guess what, that's all opinion at the end of the day. I personally thought Lopez was a decent here. She gave a great performance showing her outlook of a person who's had a traumatic past. The AI robots induced some hateful behavior putting you at the edge of your seat feeling a sense of hope for the main character to make it. AI smith was a believable character reminding me of prior works of Eve from Walle and Bumble Bee from Transformers. I drew loads of comparisons from Transformers to this movie and that made it that much more witty and exhilarating. Movies shouldn't always draw from facts, and this movie draws from a wonderful bubble of fiction that blends real well. I loved it!"

Interesting concepts, interesting plot, futuristic I tell you especially with the advancements in human evolution. Pretty sick. I loved the barrier that they have put outside earth, something good.

I was so impressed at how she became the character Atlas Shepard.Without giving away the plots twist and turns, the director, cinematographer, animation were all in sync to keep me glued to the screen from start to finish. It was wonderfully paced throughout.Simu Liu has come such a long way from the Corner Gas TV series. I felt this performance reminded be a bit of Ricardo Montalban in StarTrek II wrath of khan. The wonderful synchronicity of that kind of perfect casting for a character.I honestly didn't know anything about the plot going in and I think that was a good thing. So I tried to write my review without any particular details.I usually save my 10s for movies like Gleason or It's Not Yet Dark but this one earned it in my opinion.

She delivers a powerhouse performance that cements her status as the ultimate girl boss, effortlessly outshining her male counterparts at every turn.From the very first scene, Lopez commands the screen with a magnetic presence that is impossible to ignore. Her portrayal of Atlas, a fierce and determined heroine, is both empowering and inspiring. Lopez brings a depth and complexity to the character that showcases her incredible range as an actress. She embodies strength, intelligence, and resilience, proving that she is more than capable of taking on any challenge thrown her way.What sets Lopez's performance apart is her ability to blend vulnerability with unwavering determination. She navigates the high-stakes world of futuristic warfare with a grace and confidence that makes her character incredibly relatable and human. Her male counterparts, though talented, simply can't keep up with her sheer charisma and skill. Lopez's Atlas is a leader in every sense of the word, making strategic decisions and outsmarting her enemies with ease.The action sequences in ""Atlas"" are nothing short of breathtaking, and Lopez executes them with precision and agility. Each fight scene is a testament to her dedication and hard work, and she makes every punch, kick, and dodge look effortless. Her physical prowess is matched only by her emotional depth, creating a well-rounded and compelling character that viewers can't help but root for.Beyond the action, Lopez also brings a sense of heart and humanity to the film. Her interactions with other characters are genuine and heartfelt, and she elevates the performances of those around her. The chemistry she shares with her co-stars is palpable, but it's clear that she is the true star of the show. Her male counterparts, while competent, are simply overshadowed by her brilliance and command of the role.""Atlas"" is a thrilling ride from start to finish, and Jennifer Lopez's performance is the driving force behind its success. She proves time and time again that she is a force to be reckoned with, both on and off the screen. Lopez's portrayal of Atlas is nothing short of iconic, and she sets a new standard for what it means to be a true girl boss. If you're looking for a film that celebrates strength, intelligence, and the indomitable spirit of a woman who can do it all, ""Atlas"" is an absolute must-watch. Bravo, Jennifer Lopez - you've outdone yourself once again!"

Naturally, I compared it to J-Lo's previous films, which often received less appreciation.When I discovered that the science fiction-themed film Atlas involved AI, Mechs, and other planets, I anticipated watching another subpar movie from J-Lo. However, I 'dared' myself to watch it because Mark Strong was also involved in the film.Perhaps this time J-Lo won the bet by starring in a genre she doesn't usually play. Simu Liu's performance greatly contributed to the film's development.The storyline is straightforward and concise. Not once did it make me feel sleepy. The entire story is presented without long pauses and monotony.The sound and visuals in this film are not excessive but still provide a profound, surreal sensation. The music composed by Andrew Lockington enhances the atmosphere of each scene, making it more dramatic and lively.In conclusion, I can say that J-Lo succeeded with this film, making me want to watch it again to appreciate every detail. It also made me eager to play Titanfall 2 again as soon as possible."
"9","The Unconscious Atlas: Navigating Emotions to Shape the Future","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9806119/?ref_=tt_urv","janaris","24 May 2024","Atlas delves deep into the intricate relationship between transhumanism and transcendence, weaving a narrative that challenges viewers to ponder the coexistence of these realms.The film masterfully portrays a superhuman entity as the amalgamation of both, showcasing their ability to bridge emotion and analytical thought.Moreover, the intricate emotional landscape of the protagonist serves as a pivotal element, highlighting how the unconscious mind can intricately shape the course of the future. By delving into the complexities of the protagonist's emotions, the film underscores the profound influence of the unconscious on one's decisions and ultimately, the path ahead.This exploration adds a rich layer to the narrative, illustrating the profound impact of internal struggles on the shaping of destiny.With thought-provoking writing, ""Atlas"" compels audiences to contemplate the evolving role of artificial intelligence in elevating human consciousness. A captivating exploration of futuristic themes that resonates with the complexities of our technological age."
"9","Optimum connection","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9809137/?ref_=tt_urv","glynmaclean","26 May 2024","Who and what can you trust? Human emotion takes centre stage in this poignant film about our relationship with AI and automation. Perfectly executed CGI interfaces with the pinnacle of acting in this breakthrough blockbuster that has it all. Can an AI feel love? Could we love an AI back? Who can we trust?do you trust yourself? ATLAS presents that notion that we can't achieve the optimum connection without being honest with ourselves and others. Whether AI or human, trust in truth is personified the peak performance of Jennifer Lopez. Perhaps the real magic here is that JLo has programmed some green screen envy by humanising CGI with a raw, emotive performance worthy of becoming SciFi legend. ATLAS is an epic movie which will comfortably earn its place in ScFI legend."
"10","Whats up with all the bad reviews? I want Part 2!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9814306/?ref_=tt_urv","javiergarcon","29 May 2024","I just watched this on Netflix and it was a load of fun watching it. My eyes was glued to the screen, and not once did I pause except for when I went to the bathroom with my $400 wireless headset, and when I came back, I rewound the movie to what I missed and watched it. What I just told you should give you loads to think about this movie and why it is a 10-star movie, not a 4-star one.Where to start? The camera angles were not unique! They didn't do any edgy camera angle stuff in this movie, so dont try to compare it to Jackie Chan movies. The audio was amazingly superb! Thats where this movie excels! The music scores and sound effects were second to none, especially on a distant foreign space planet! I liked it when they explored another planet for the first time in human history in a galaxy far, far away. It shows how Humanity has progressed into the future because of a rogue AI that has killed 3 billion people on Earth and escaped to another planet.Now, the best part about this movie is the Social Science aspect, where Humanity decided to work together and focus all its expenses on protecting the Earth from that one evil entity that will return. It seems people worldwide are more afraid of AI than people themselves and decide to stop fighting wars against each other and prepare for the worst to come. The Terminator ""WILL BE BACK"" lol. I genuinely like the Terminator references in this movie. I truly felt that Humanity can set their differences aside to fight for one common cause because that cause is more dangerous than any other cause in the universe. It is an interesting Social Science experiment. The theory is sound, and it might happen to our children in the future, but unfortunately, we won't be alive to witness it ever happening. Once again, this is a science fiction film based on particular technological real-world applications we use today and fantasy in a social science experiment that examines the possibility that Humanity might come to peace if AI is a more significant threat.I found this movie intriguing and loved it from start to finish. The actors had me on the edge of my seat, and I truly enjoyed how the leading actor was an AI person who slowly had to confirm to trust the technology. If not, it would not work. This movie is unique, and I hope they will come out with part 2. I want to know more about Earth and hope Smith can save the day again. SPOILER: You know that Harlem is still alive? He is always thinking ten steps ahead and has already taken steps ahead, especially if his brain has been deactivated. Meaning? If he cloned the other Cyborgs, he cloned himself! He seemed to be a megalomaniac type. What do you think?"

I to the world and what are the ramifications of it turning rogue. The answer came in the form Simu Liu who plays a very convincing A. I named Harlan. Jennifer Lopez turns in a stellar performance as a data analyst named Atlas Shepard who has a very valid distrust of All A. I. due to family trauma. I thought the movie at times was funny and emotional and I loved the buddy cop feel of Atlas being forced to bond with A Sassy A. I mech suit named Smith. It is easy to criticize this movie as some have done for being overly ambitious, pandering to low taste, being too simple or too complex, with too few actors or too many, or even for celebrating revenge violence against professional critics who write negative reviews. They may all be correct, but these critics will still put themselves in the same category as those that warned audiences against 2001 or Blade Runner."

It's a bit of a slow starter, but once the action starts, you'll be in love with it. I couldn't stop watching. Whoever said jennifer lopez can't act hasn't seen this movie. It wasn't predictable or too much like other films. The performances were extraordinary all the way around. The conclusion was entirely satisfying. I would recommend it to anyone.

This one had a great story that kept me engaged. No problem with the acting whatsoever. We're not here for the awards, just the action, imagination and ability to take you into the imagined future. This movie does just that.AI is still developing and this flick gives us an idea of how it can play out in the future. Just think about how much we interact with technology now. Our phones learn everything we do, our Smart Homes learn everything we do and our cars are getting there. They're all networked to somewhere learning what we do, and it's only just begun.... Imagine what it will be like 10, 50, or even 100 years from now. This movie is but one possibility of where it can lead....

I would say 9/10 but because everyone is scoring down I felt I needed to do the film some justice. I absolutely loved it. If you're not a critic and you just enjoy sci-fi and action then this film is for you. I loved the storyline, it was heartfelt and I loved Smith. It's a fun and constantly moving movie. J Lo still has it and considering she's alone a lot, she really brought some feeling to this film. Honestly fight me on that. Do not take the score as an indicator as to whether to watch or not. Make up your own mind! It's enjoyable and it's made me really want them to do a second one."

The film is not perfect, it has some plot flows, sometimes a bit too much emotion, and maybe just a bit too much special effects here but that is for sure not a 5 or less rating. This is a solid si-fi movie, JLo acts pretty well (no Oscar winning but definitely good for this movie), it has suspense, it is quite entertaining, the special effects are (although maybe a bit too much) very good for a Netflix movie. Will I watch it again - maybe not, but did I think it was a bad movie and a waste of time - absolutely not. I like seeing JLo in these types of productions - she is always committed to her performance."

My family has met her before and she is a nice person who was truly caring. This cancel-culture needs to stop. It doesn't only affect the big stars but also everyone who worked on this project, their livelihoods matter. There were moments where JLo showed her range and times she over-acted. Lana Parrilla also did amazing for the short time she was on-screen. People need to give JLo a break and rate her on her talent and not this vendetta they have to cancel her. Many people work on films-give them their credit too."

You see, they can't!!This movie was engaging, tech savvy, call me local but the bond between Atlas and the AI was actually what you would love to see between humans and AI.Then it also shows us that we can trust, we can create and definitely make sure no loop holes cos the loop holes made H what he was.So watch the movie, you'll enjoy it. I promise you.ML: Just bcos one egg decided to be bad doesn't mean the whole bunch should suffer for it or be condemned."

The CGI is undeniably impressive, elevating the movie with its stunning visual effects. Action sequences are abundant and well-executed, keeping viewers engaged throughout. Jennifer Lopez's performance is commendable, showcasing her versatility in portraying a range of emotions within complex situations. While the storyline may not break new ground, it still holds up well, albeit feeling slightly rushed at times. Overall, it's a highly enjoyable movie that stands out amidst the plethora of lackluster offerings on Netflix. Worth a watch for sure."

Packed with action and suspense, this visually stunning film showcases the undeniable talent of its star and the intriguing concept of a future where artificial intelligence poses a real threat. Despite its flaws, Atlas offers an entertaining escape into a world where the boundaries between humanity and technology are pushed to their limits.""Atlas"" proves to be an enthralling and thought-provoking cinematic experience, anchored by Jennifer Lopez's commanding performance. Its exploration of artificial intelligence's impact on humanity is timely and relevant, offering a stark warning of a future that may not be too far away. This movie was rated way too low."
"8","Atlas has more heart than AI should","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9809280/?ref_=tt_urv","ricdesan","26 May 2024","With a bit of a slow start and a pretty conventional AI gone wrong setup I still gave this film more of a chance as some astute IMDB reviewers warned me to do.Of course JLo seemed like curious casting here with what seemed initially a hard one dimensional character, but once you get to the 25min mark in the film and the hunt for the villain rogue AI is under way this film and its action gets high strung and quite interesting very quickly.What transpires is a character study and neat speculation about the elasticity of a more distant AI that became quite interesting and a much more emotional human story than I would have remotely imagined. Is it perfect? Not so much. But what it is - is entertaining with impeccable eye candy CGI that will warm the heart of any olden day Mech Warrior game fan with its ode to that seminal PC game. It is the best on screen representation yet of that virtual world.Ultimately what you get is what you would hope for ... a reconsideration of a much maligned movie trope and that makes it so very well worth your time. I ended up liking this far more than I thought I would."

But when I watched it, I realized that it is much better than expected. The storyline and direction are good. Jennifer's acting is also at a good level.In a movie like this, some expect serious things. But sometimes we need to see a simple story because there is often a lack of good Sci Fi movies. This has a slight similarity to the story of the video game Titanfall and it is also a matter of pleasure to get the artificial intelligence inspiration that everyone is hoping for. Overall. As a whole, it can be called as a film that can be successful. Thanks to netflix."

It's exactly what you expect, plain and simple: a sci-fi movie about AI, robots, explosions and the world in danger.The AI displayed is interesting (even though not super creative); robots are nice; explosions happened; world was in danger. All checked.Finally, not sure why Jennifer Lopez is kind of being cancelled for being casted to the movie, but she did a good job convincing me about her emotions in several parts of it. I agree that not in all, however it didn't compromise the experience for me at all.I would 100% watch this movie again with my little nephews, cousins or something like that."
"9","Actiontainment meets philosophical musings","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9820358/?ref_=tt_urv","elsiebobek","1 June 2024","The entertainment factor of this movie was a solid 10.The CGI was surprisingly good, or at least far better than I had anticipated.I enjoyed that the movie didn't waste much time with a tedious set-up and found a way to incorporate protagonist Atlas' background story with quick flashbacks.The action is nicely interspersed with philosophical questions about what constitutes life if A. I. can sense (""feel"") and people are programmed to act ot think in certaon ways via their DNA, upbringing, military training et al. Add to that that even rewilded animals act on instinct (""programming"") and things can get complex. The message was more that life is versatile and not necessarily for humans to define or lord over.Of course, any movie with this topic always reminds of Battlestar Galactica. With the reboot show already being 20 years old, I have to say Atlas does bring a lot of new elements, questions and issues to the table.As so often, I thought it could have been shorter. Length does not equal quality. I feel like filmmakers increasingly ignore or forget this simple fact.For the main duration of the movie, Jennifer Lopez virtually has no one to play off of. She's alone in a robot-shell and has to pretend she's talking to and hearing him. (The A. I. robot's responses were added in post production.) This makes her performance even more impressive to me. There was one reviewer who clained she was walking around as if she had sticks for legs. So for those who didn't pay attention and then unfairly rated/reviewed: Lopez' character Atlas was gravely injured and in great pain while trying to survive in a hostile and strange world. The only way to do that is to work with A. I. despite her understandable hatred of it. So her alleged constant whining/crying/agonized face is quite understandable in that light. She did a pretty fantastic job, all these things considered."

The only thing i don't like is the bad guy, his (it?) story is credible but the acting is not good enough, kind of flat. . The narrative weaves together intense action sequences with deep emotional arcs, creating a compelling tale of unlikely alliances and the quest for peace."

I'm not traditionally a fan of Jennifer Lopez but I thought she did well as the lead role, and put the right amount of emotion in given the seriousness of the scenes and plotline. I enjoyed the variation between action and story because I'm really tired of seeing movies with one action scene after another. It was a very enjoyable watch that entertains many ideas about the future of AI, both good and bad, and I like the other planet element a lot. I did think that the soldiers didn't get enough screen time and could have expanded their time a bit more so the film was a bit less like cast away with one sole actor carry it all."

The pace and energy was consistent with the age of todays' storytelling.I enjoyed a good futuristic science fiction story arch that left a plausible aspect of merging realities and considered consequences. Also, answering if we can come back from decisions made or not.The graphics were believable enough to sell the story. The graphics and the storytelling of the AI relationship provided a 2/3rds share to be carried and responsibility to support the story in my opinion.I think Jennifer Lopez has found her niche and genre as an action star."
"10","Top notch Sci-Fri Action drama movie after a long time","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9805926/?ref_=tt_urv","grv-signature10","24 May 2024","""Atlas"" is a movie that, from its opening moments, captivated me with its engaging setup and compelling characters, particularly the protagonists, Atlas and Smith. As a massive movie buff, I found myself instantly glued to the screen, eagerly absorbing every detail. The film manages to blend a fun, exhilarating atmosphere with a thoughtful narrative, making it a standout entry in the sci-fi genre.One of the most striking aspects of ""Atlas"" is its seamless world-building. The filmmakers have created a universe that feels both expansive and intimately detailed.The characters of Atlas and Smith are the heart of the movie. Their dynamic is both entertaining and emotionally resonant, providing a strong foundation for the film's plot.One of the reasons ""Atlas"" stands out is its ability to blend action with deeper, thought-provoking themes.It combines elements of classic science fiction with innovative ideas, resulting in a unique and highly enjoyable experience.Comparing ""Atlas"" to other notable sci-fi works, such as ""The Mandalorian,"" I can confidently say that it holds its own. Like ""The Mandalorian,"" ""Atlas"" offers a mix of thrilling action, engaging characters, and a richly detailed world. However, ""Atlas"" brings its own flavor to the genre, making it a must-watch for any sci-fi enthusiast.The film's direction is another highlight. The director has managed to balance the various elements of the story, ensuring that each scene contributes to the overall narrative. The pacing is spot-on, with each moment building tension and driving the plot forward. The cinematography is equally impressive, capturing the beauty and complexity of the film's setting.One of the film's greatest achievements is its ability to evoke a range of emotions. There are moments of intense action, heartfelt emotion, and even humor, all seamlessly woven together. This emotional depth adds another layer to the film, making it more than just a typical sci-fi adventure.The performances of the cast are also worth mentioning. The actors bring their characters to life with genuine passion and skill. Their chemistry is palpable, adding authenticity to their interactions and making the story more engaging. The standout performances by the leads, Atlas and Smith, are particularly noteworthy, as they anchor the film with their compelling portrayals.I do not understand why people are downrating the movie. I would give this a solid 9. Thoroughly enjoyed the movie and the acting performances. I think this could be a solid comeback for the JLO.Final thoughts:""Atlas"" is an engaging sci-fi film with captivating characters, impressive world-building, and a compelling plot. Despite some criticism, it's a must-watch for genre fans, deserving a solid 9-star rating."
"10","Generic and Lackluster","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9806419/?ref_=tt_urv","syd9907","24 May 2024","I watched Atlas (it's now on Netflix), and while Sterling K. Brown is a superb actor, I can't fathom why he chose to be part of such a bland film. Plus, here's an Emmy, SAG, Critics Choice, NAACP Image Award, Golden Globe winner and Oscar-nominated actor, whose talents are totally wasted and is basically an afterthought in Atlas. I have some questions???? Atlas is just another mediocre addition to Jennifer Lopez's filmography, which also includes a recent, laughable documentary. Lopez has always excelled at self-promotion and dancing, but her acting often falls short. The hype around ""Jenny from the Block"" (a myth in itself) caught me briefly, but I quickly moved on.As someone who screens many films, I've seen the full spectrum from great to downright bad, and Atlas falls into the latter category, though not excruciatingly bad, but it does leave a lot to be desired. The storyline is entirely predictable, recycling elements from countless other sci-fi films. We've all seen bits and pieces of Atlas over and over again, just pick a sci-fi film. The character A. I. Smith, Lopez's AI protector, is reminiscent of The Matrix, and the suit she's is right out of Pacific Rim, which doesn't help the film's originality. Lopez's performance is inconsistent, with overacting in some scenes and underperforming in others. The dialogue is flat, and the action sequences are extremely lackluster. However, the set design is impressive, and the CGI-rendered Los Angeles cityscape is phenomenal.In the end, Atlas left me wanting much more, and I got far less. If I had paid to see this film in a theater, I would have been tempted to ask for a refund."

A little gory but reminds of Alien movies back in the day only less campy. If you want to have some fun watch this! Dont know why critics are demolishing it but get a life

I also don't watch them to try to figure out where they're going to go. I watch movies to have a good time, and enjoy myself for a little while- so if you're like me this is the movie for you. The idea of AI becoming self aware and wanting to rule is a tried and true sci-fi trope, kind of like aliens invading planet Earth. But this is no Terminator rip off. The characters, even the non-human ones, are well developed and very believable for the situation they're in. And once the situation is presented, it's a non-stop action Fest. And some great new ideas for the plot keep it moving. This was a great way to spend some time, and so good I am probably going to watch it again in the near future."

So after seeing the journey of Lopez through this role and how the AI acts a therapist I have come to see how it has the potential to help people. But also manipulate people, but all around 10/10 movie for me, because of my personal connection. Movies rated badly by one may be rated good by others. There are some that are terrible don't get me wrong but in seeking connections with films rather than entertainment. I found a connection, one that brought tears to my eyes and joy in my heart. AI has potential for bad but also for good and in the blink of an eye AI certainly could be like this film.Little Science Section:
With the advent of liquid neural networks that can adapt to any environment and the potential to combine them with Large Language Models as well as the usage of RAG technology I could see how the mech suit could come about. As well as the fact that a closed loop system could be possible with how fast computing is evolving, if you have enough money abt. $3,500 you could host an AI surprisingly fast, and for about $1,000 somewhat slow but still functional. The point is AI is coming fast and shows like this are important to show the potential for both destruction and creation. So I loved the show."

IT GETS BETTER!That is what makes the quality of a film!Also: great story! Great effects and animations! Supporting cast very good as well! Exciting right to the end!I give this film a 10 to make up for all the premature bad reviews!It's a solid 7,5 in the science fiction genre!"

This movie made me laugh, cry, and care. We need that at a time like this. No spoilers, but somehow heartbreak feels good with J lo by your side. You CAN trust AI, but I don't need AI, this comes from MY heart. J lo truly sparkles. Just a crazy lil girl from The Bronx so free. This role was created with Jennifer Lopez in mind. It's really something. It's Atlas. You want more??? J lo gives more. This is what cinema should look like. All directors take notes. She really gives it her all. It's awe inspiring and so deeply personal. Love."

By the way, this game was also very underrated back then. Main story line ofvthe game was very good, aside action, focused on Titan - pilot relationship. Similar as in Atlas movie. Of course it could be more smart. Main plot was obvious from the beggining. Nevertheless I enjoied this film very much. Famele haracter was quite good. JLo was ok to watch, looked good and convincing. SF effects looks very nice, didnt feel cheap. Overall a good movie. Should get better reviews in my opinion. And thank you Netflix for trying new things.."

I.) but ya can't have everything.It was definitley enjoyable - would recommend it to fans of Lopez and action/adventure. Especially enjoyed the conversations with ""Smith"" good blend of serious and humor - sarcasism and more which made the move very entertaining.A very good ""date night"" adventure - would like to see more from the aftermath - why this world had SO many different landscapes? Went from snow, to desert, to forest and back - nice place to visit I suppose."

Much to my dismay, armadillos found my vegetables and destroyed it all. Heartbroken, I sought solace in a tv movie and found Atlas. I am a profound fan of overacting, crying and complaining. Nothing takes my mind off of a lost harvest like an action filled sci fi movie with a dance and pop legend. I could feel the camera on Jenn on every scene. The transparency of her conjured emotions was indeed comforting.Her manufactured rage at AI and her frustrations were epic at taking my mind off of my armadillo problems. If only Jenn was here, keeping a vigilant watch over my crops. Perhaps her bottom lip would tremble at her witnessing the horde of armadillos eat the last of my tender okra? One can only wish. I pray there is a an Atlas 2,3 and 4. Who knows what pestilence might attack my corn next year. Thank you Jennifer Lopez!!!!"

This movie was far more technically creative and technologically innovative than just about any recent mainstream movie. If this was an anime it would have scored in high 8s, but it is a live action movie so it attracts audience that has different expectations.See it for the concepts and hypothetical scenario exploration, not for exploration of human character and their relationship with their universe.I recommend it for anyone interested in emerging technologies. Ignore the low score."

Like why would AI act in the way it does, but it's an interesting move regardless.The main painpoints are the action scenes in my opinion, i think it could have done with less of them.Don't let the other reviews fool you, give it a shot and make up your mind on your own.

Ended up being surprisingly good with a decent storyline. Characters had decent development, but the visuals were on point overall, it is a very entertaining movie worth watching. This movie had a little bit of irobot meets Megan. A combo I never thought I would find so entertaining. Definitely gonna go back and rewatch it a few more times overall, I really enjoy the movie. Jennifer lopez gives a pretty good performance, but it isn't perfect. Still, I think she was the perfect cast for this type of movie. You are really going to fall in love with Smith. Whoever did the storyline for him was a genius."

Now it makes me want to watch other movies on Netflix that cater to the genre. The full cast was highly entertaining, the crew did such a superb job with the all round lighting & effects throughout the movie.

Think of excellent director, actors, CGI so good that it feels real, great story line and wonderful script. And yes j lo nailed it in this one. I wasn't expecting much seeing the reviews but I agree that people are just hating instead of truly writing what needs to be said: this is a grade A sci fi with engaging action from start to finish but moreover with a very strong theme about the dangers of AI in a future where we might actually reach. More importantly, the acting is so solid, the actors fit perfectly and finally it's just so entertaining! Final verdict is forget the bad reviews and give this a chance, you won't regret it."

AI can help humanity but again it's not as simple as shown in the movie. AI was supposed to do laundry/ house cleaning so that I can write better poetry and not write better poetry so that I have time for laundry. The way AI is posing competition in every field and replacing humans ( very few humans work on AI so it's not same number is comsumed in job market as many are replaced but this movies shows a place where AI and human can work as sync. My issue is AI is seen taking commands from human still when in reality AI can think by learning . It was an entertaining take where we see hierarchal order even among AI army. It gives food for thought and transports you into a different world."

J-Lo absolutely nailed it. I will definitely watch out for her in other movies. Really surprised, kept me watching all the way through - which is very unusual. Loved the casting. Good special effects - good humour including sarcasm (which to be honest Americans struggle to get). All in all an excellent movie. As I am interested in the movie I don't care who directed it or who is in it. All you perfectionists need to calm down and back off - it's a really good movie - well done J-Lo. A good strong plot."
"8","Jennifer Lopez's acting in this movie was so powerful that it made me cry.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9821262/?ref_=tt_urv","JerryrFlanagan","2 June 2024","Jennifer Lopez's acting in this movie was so powerful that it made me cry. Unless you have exceptional acting abilities, it's quite difficult to pull off in an AI action fantasy film. ""Jenny From The Block"" has made significant progress in her acting abilities over the past 10 years, and I am filled with pride for her. She has made significant progress in her acting career. Of course, being an executive producer of this film can also increase her chances of landing a leading role in an action fantasy movie. I have been working in the field of information technology for 30 years, earning a living. This film script is incredibly convincing and has effectively depicted the fears shared by many developed countries for the past two decades. This movie explores the disastrous consequences that can occur when GenAI bots gain cognitive abilities and go rogue. On the other hand, the movie script also demonstrates the positive aspects of connecting human consciousness to GenAI in the afterlife. Envision a world where humans can live well beyond 100 years old, still cherishing family dinners and actively participating in enjoyable activities as cyborgs. AI is here for the long haul, which means we'll need to learn how to navigate it, just as we did when cars took over from horses as the primary mode of transportation."

I found it rather refreshing because most things I've seen revolve around the same concepts. War, super heroes, anime etc but this one was different from the usual mold. Saw it at the comfort of my own home with the family while popping our own popcorn and drinking our favorite beer/soda. Yes the movie could've been Jesus's second coming but why? Why does every movie need to blow you off your seat? Why can't you just enjoy something for what it is with your family from the comfort of your own home. It's probably because most reviewers have a bone to pick with Jennifer Lopez or are jaded due to other movies with significantly bigger budgets. I say enjoy life, the fact you're even able to watch a movie this long and can't live to cry about it online...."

It is quite funny to me when people state that Jlo was a surprisingly good actress here because she has and will always be a really good acress. Her personal lofe has nothing to do with it.I found myself engrossed and unable to speak even though I was watching it with others until the movie ended. There were several times I thought all hope was gone but a surprising twist was always waiting in the corner.Say whatever you want about Jlo but every movie she has starred in has been a heavy hitter.

If I had to pay 70$ at the movie theaters in one night to see this, then I would've given this a very negative scoreLike I said, this was a perfect movie for Netflix! It had all the basic things; a backstory, immediate action to start, continuity in building relationships between characters, wit and comedy, heroics, climax and ending.The acting was fine for what this was, a Netflix movie that you don't have to waste gas, extra money on seats and high priced theater food! JLO is always at her best in movies that have her acting with short dialogue between characters, high emotions, and action!Sterling K complimented JLO very well for the short amount of scene work he had. In alll stop basing everything off Marvel movies and reset expectations with the lower budget action sci-fi movies. It's a minimum 8 out of 10 but for me it was 10/10."

I was crying the entire last half of the movie. I love that the camera angles weren't overdone on the action scenes normally there's way too many camera angles I get dizzy and I lose track of the what's happening in the storyline and this one had just enough camera angles where you could actually keep your eyes on the screen the entire movie and know what was happening in those action scenes. Normally they overdo action scenes with way too many camera angles and it just makes it unwatchable so first action movie I could actually get through. Go see it."

overall it was very entertaining , and thats what ANY movie is meant to be right? If its entertaining then it is a success

Atlas, (Jennifer Lopez) does a kind of ""Ripley"" (Sigourney Weaver) as she is accompanied by a well trained elite force as they go to a strange inhospitable planet near andromeda galaxy to hunt an extremely dangerous rogue Robot. Most everything goes wrong that could go wrong as she is forced to ""trust"" the AI system currently in her possession. Not an easy task for Atlas. Great redemption story, awesome effects and fighting scenes as well as lots of pyrotechnics. Nothing questionable, no nudity, no horror or lots of gore, some graphic violence and some foul language well placed. Ok for young adults, may be a bit extreme for kiddos. Don't let the bad reviews ruin a fun and enjoyable adventure that may seem like other movies ( terminator, colossus, Hal) but this outing is quite a bit different and unique in its own way. We will see this several more times for sure. Enjoy!"

"10","Jenifer Lopez should never be allowed to act in a movie again","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9818651/?ref_=tt_urv","adeyinkaamole","31 May 2024","Atlas,"" starring Jennifer Lopez, is a film that many anticipated with high expectations, given Lopez's past successes in the entertainment industry. Unfortunately, this movie falls short in several key areas, leaving viewers disappointed and questioning Lopez's future in Hollywood. Jennifer Lopez should never be allowed to act in a movie again. Her performance in this movie was really terrible. Age is definitely catching up with her. She needs to retire from the movie industry. Her unnecessary screaming in the movie was really horrible. One of the most glaring issues with ""Atlas"" is Jennifer Lopez's performance. Known for her charisma and dynamic screen presence, Lopez has had a storied career that includes both critically acclaimed films and box office hits. However, in ""Atlas,"" her portrayal of the lead character is nothing short of disastrous. Her acting feels forced and unnatural, lacking the emotional depth and nuance that the role demands. The once captivating star seems to be struggling to keep up with the younger actors, and her performance is marred by a series of over-the-top reactions and unconvincing expressions. The character she plays is supposed to be a seasoned, world-weary individual with layers of complexity. Instead, Lopez delivers a one-dimensional performance that fails to resonate with the audience. Her unnecessary screaming throughout the movie is particularly grating, adding an element of annoyance rather than tension or excitement. These moments feel out of place and disrupt the flow of the narrative, making it difficult for viewers to remain engaged. Moreover, the dialogue in ""Atlas"" is poorly written, which only exacerbates Lopez's struggles. The script is filled with clich√©d lines and melodramatic exchanges that would challenge even the most skilled actors. Lopez, unfortunately, does not rise to the occasion. Her delivery is often flat and unconvincing, making it hard for the audience to connect with her character on any meaningful level. The direction and pacing of the film also contribute to its downfall. The plot is disjointed, with numerous subplots that are never fully developed or resolved. This lack of cohesion makes it hard to follow the story and invest in the characters. The director's attempt to blend various genres-action, drama, and science fiction-results in a muddled mess that lacks a clear identity or direction. Visually, ""Atlas"" is a mixed bag. While there are moments of impressive special effects and striking cinematography, these are overshadowed by the film's numerous shortcomings. The action sequences, which should be the highlight of a movie like this, are poorly choreographed and lack the intensity needed to keep viewers on the edge of their seats. Instead, they feel repetitive and uninspired, failing to deliver the adrenaline rush that fans of the genre expect. The supporting cast also suffers from the film's overall mediocrity. Talented actors are given little to work with, resulting in performances that are largely forgettable. The lack of character development and meaningful interactions makes it difficult to care about their fates, further diminishing the impact of the story. In terms of its themes, ""Atlas"" attempts to tackle grand ideas about human existence, technology, and the future of our world. However, these themes are handled clumsily and lack the depth required to make a lasting impression. The film's message is lost amidst the chaotic plot and poor execution, leaving viewers with little to ponder after the credits roll. In conclusion, ""Atlas"" is a disappointing entry in Jennifer Lopez's filmography. Her performance, marred by overacting and a lack of emotional depth, is one of the many reasons this movie fails to deliver. Combined with a weak script, poor direction, and lackluster action sequences, ""Atlas"" is a film that is best avoided. For those who admire Jennifer Lopez's earlier work, it is disheartening to see her talent wasted in such a subpar production. It might be time for Lopez to consider stepping back from the big screen and exploring other avenues where her skills can be better utilized."

Atlas 2 and 3 I'm ready.I'm not going to add spoilers or comment about the movie much. I will say that all this AI technological stuff is exactly what I need. Just get me everything in this movie. The phones, cars, flying cars, Etc. I need all that.I hope after watching this movie, most people will walk away feeling at ease that J lo saved humanity. If you're a avid fan of sci fi and New York actors, then you already know. New Yorkers can never be stopped. I myself am a proud New Yorker and love watching J lo movies. Now get us Atlas 2 and 3 asap."
"9","Break out popcorn, suspend belief, and just enjoy it.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9810159/?ref_=tt_urv","chantellervheerden","26 May 2024","TL;DR: We've gotten so used to expecting team-focused, story-driven, high-budget groundbreakers that are scientifically accurate to the n'th degree, that we've reached the point where we can't even suspend belief long enough to enjoy a fun and emotional action sci-fi character story. Will it win any awards? Probably not. But that doesn't mean Atlas isn't worth breaking out the popcorn and just going along for the ride. I enjoyed it immensely, and will likely watch it again.FULL REVIEW:
I read several reviews before watching the movie, and I went in expecting it to be bad. Maybe that's why I was pleasantly surprised to find myself really enjoying it. There was once or twice where I nearly dropped into the pit of expecting more... scientific realism, not to mention that the CGI could be better in some spots, and only the main character really seems to be fleshed out in any way. Here's the thing, though - why is that a problem?Films like Interstellar and The Martian has rather spoiled us on the accurate sciency-space-saga front. We've also seen more cast-focused films in the decades since Lord of the Rings that we've almost come to expect movie plotlines that are driven by fleshed-out groups of characters. Not to mention that big budget blockbusters like Dune means we expect top tier quality from all sets, soundtracks, and CGI. But judging Atlas against those giants of cinema is unfair.This isn't a space saga, an exploration of the power of team work, or even a film and story that's pushing new boundaries. And, quite frankly, it doesn't need to be groundbreaking to be enjoyable. In essence, Atlast is, in my humble opinion, a fun science fiction film that plays in the realm of movies like Edge of Tomorrow, The Tomorrow War, and I, Robot - with which is shares similarities - and the mention of Asimov in a movie about robots and AI had me giggling in joy.I have to praise J-Lo's performance - and I don't even like her as either an actress or a singer. But, by the end, I was crying for her and her story. Atlas is a character-driven and -focused film, much like movies like Castaway, I am Legend, Gravity, and Moon. No one else is around long enough for you to really give a right squat about them, but you don't need to. You just have to focus on Atlas and Smith, her growth, struggles, and overcoming a tragic mistake.In short, we've gotten so used to expecting team-focused, story-driven, high-budget groundbreakers that are scientifically accurate to the n'th degree, that we've reached the point where we can't even suspend belief long enough to enjoy a fun and emotional action sci-fi character story. Will it win any awards? Probably not. But that doesn't mean that it's not worth breaking out the popcorn and just going along for the ride. I enjoyed it immensely, and will likely watch it again."
"10","Wow... just wow...","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9808246/?ref_=tt_urv","etpvsrw","25 May 2024","I do not write a lot of reviews on IMDB, only when I think a rating is wrong, really wrong.How can this movie (at the time of writing) have a rating of 5,6. Freaking unbelievable. This must be one of the best science fiction movie I have seen in recent years. Heck, one of the best movie I have seen in recent years (next to top gun) period. Jennifer Lopez shows some decent acting and the special effects are out of this world. I am a big Star Wars fan and love the entire franchise (except for the animation movies) but I think this science fiction movie is better. I suffer from ADHD and one of my problems is I can't concentrate enough to watch a movie in one time. I usually start a movie or series episode and within a half hour I'll be doing something else after which I return to the movie and so on... only in special cases (very good movies or series) I can watch it in one time. You probably guessed it, I watched Atlas in one time. It was great to watch. As a tech lover it really had me glued to my screen. I can't begin to explain how I enjoyed this movie. And enjoyed Jennifer Lopez, she keeps looking beautiful as ever.This movie is a must watch and I hope a lot of people will write reviews and rate it a 10 because that is what it deserves."
"9","A great movie for adults and kids","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9808881/?ref_=tt_urv","babytete-83646","26 May 2024","I love how they used an OG actress like J Lo. Her acting was the reason I loved the movie so much. You can feel her emotion through her acting.I love the story line and think it was executed in great manner. I was shocked to see the quality and effects used in a movie that wasn't in theaters.I think kids and adults will enjoy this movie. With a little cursing, it was enjoyable where I would feel safe to watch with the kids.Refreshing to see a movie that didn't involve a love story or sex scene.A little predictable here and there, but it wasn't corny. I'm excited to see if there's a part 2 coming out."
"8","Ms Lopez, you really surprises in Atlas","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9816281/?ref_=tt_urv","posmedley63","30 May 2024","I went into this,thinking it was going to be really, truly awful. Jenny-From-the Block as the lead in an action, sci-fi movie, right. A movie with Mecha, AI gone bad, without a romantic interest? Right? Was I ever wrong.Let me start by saying, I could easily make references to a dozen, good, sci-fi action flicks. But it wouldn't be fair. I don't want to spoil anything or say anything to turn you away from a fun, summertime movie.I'm assuming this was a personal project, for Ms Lopez. I have to give her props. She has a way of finding a role, not necessarily a great role overall, but a great role for herself. She relates or see's herself in a character enough, that she not only plays well, she chews it up with confidence.'Atlas' had one or two weak moments that are easily forgiveable and quickly forgotten. (I won't say what they are, simply because you may not even notice them. I barely noticed.)So, Sterling K Brown, wow. I don't see enough of him on the big screen. No matter what I see him in, it's like a breath of death air. The role of Elias could have been ultimately phoned in, boring, and unlikable. Elias turned it into a very likeable and attention demanding role, which made the whole film that much better. He was not who most people would have considered for this particular role, but I'll come back to that.Simu Liu, as the main villain. He nailed it. Look, ever since Arnold did Terminator, or Weller in Robocop, so many actors have played the 'woke' AI that either went bad or just took over their main program. Simu poured his skills into creating a AI gone psychotic and it paid off. And again, not the first person I would have picked to play Harlan, but we'll come back to that.Abraham Popoola, is now on my follow list. I had to go through his list of films to see if I may have seen him in anything else. The few movies I may have seen, he went unnoticed by me. No more. He was frightening. And I do believe he has more screen time than the 'main villain', which kept the tension running very well. Keep an eye out for Mr Popoola.Gregory James Cohan as the voice of Smith was near perfection. I can't imagine how difficult it was to find the voice they were looking for (which may have been Hal's from 2001). Cohan's smooth, dulcet tone was enough to make you feel safe and creeped out at the same time, because 'AI', it's ability to go south and an neverending, plethora, of movies.Finally, Mark Strong. Aside from the trailer, he was what convinced me to watch Atlas. I mean, when is he NOT absolutely brilliant in any part? Well, I'm here to tell you the answer. When he is poorly written and underused. Anybody, and I mean ANY-BODY could have played the part of 'General Jake Boothe' (even the name.. ew). But they got Strong to play him. You would think there would have been better, engaging dialogue for the role simply because. It's Mark-freaking-Strong, right?! Even Strong can only do so much with nothing but throw away lines and a poorly written character. Yes, he played it to the best of his abilities and in-spite of what he had to work with, and did it as it he could. In times like this, I ask myself, 'Did they just do it for the money?' What a waste of one of the best character actors of my generation. Also, NOT who I would have cast.The 'Generals' role was small, not so much poorly written as much as barely written, so I would have cast anyone else. Plus, I'm so used to him being the bad guy that I kept waiting for him pull his face off or his eyes to flicker. Then Sterlings casting. Last I saw him was Hotel Artemis, and again, as a villain (okay, villain with an almost heart of gold). Casting him as a Colonel and real good guy, would never have been on my radar. And there is Simu Lui. The man from 10 Rings. The Hero from 10 Rings. As the villain. Quite the turn around and quite unexpected. Once you view the movie, you'll understand what I am about to say. They made the right choice and then some, for each role. Better than the 'right' choice. More like the perfect choice. Even Strong. They were wickedly evil, smart, courageous, funny, and caring. This was some brilliant casting, by choice or by luck, but brilliant. They're aren't enough movies where each actor is so perfectly cast. Lastly, it was fun to watch Ms Lopez' character develop and grow, which I believe comes from knowing the character you're playing but also from knowing yourself, your weaknesses, your strong points, and how much you have matured in your life and craft. Is she Meryl Streep? No. But then, Meryl is not Ms Lopez and that's the whole point.The runtime of 118 minutes was on the money. They could have easily turned it into a 90 minute,shove it down your throat movie. But at 118 minutes, you got some more xoll sci-fi fx, more well written story, and over all, barely a dull moment.And then they knew where (and how) to end it.There is a lot of sci-fi violence as well as 3 or 4 squeamish moments, but not so much I wouldn't let my kid watch it. There are a few bad words, but nothing shocking or unforgivable.Atlas is a good, solid, fun, and entertaining movie for all to watch. If you're still not sure, let me add one more thing. Atlas has Mech-Suites. Freaking MECH-SUITES. 'Atlas' may be the first of the Summers big hits if not the sleeper that came out of nowhere."

"10","Incredibly Entertaining!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9815972/?ref_=tt_urv","DaveBot77","30 May 2024","Found this film to be super fun. I was feeling an 8/10 on my initial watch, but it stuck with me. I kept thinking about it, tried to find something else to watch but my mind kept coming back to how much fun this film is so I watched it again. Something I almost never do with movies. Well it held up on a second watch, I may have enjoyed it even more on my second watch! Then I watched it a third time some days later. I can count on one hand how many movies I fell in love with like this and rewatched multiple times and it's why I'm giving it a 10/10.I'm not terribly surprised by the more lack luster reviews. I'd put it in the category of cheesy sci-fi. The film seems to be deliberately parodying its own genre at times and it's loaded with sci-fi tropes. Every scene seems to be trying hard to catch your interest with it's dialogue, or cool sci-fi gadget, or visual gag, or over the top explosion. It goes all in on trying to be entertaining and I think it comes off as overdone for many, but I absolutely ate it up. I always enjoy cheesy sci-fi films like this and they usually get poor reviews.But what really set it apart from other cheesy sci-fi is that it wasn't just that, it has an emotional heart and level of character development that sucked me in the way major critical acclaimed character dramas do. I fell in love with both main characters by the end and I was right there with them on this roller coaster of a movie.It tries to be both over the top fun and deeply emotional and it landed on both counts for me. Jennifer Lopez's performance is fantastic. She gets almost all of the screentime and she really carries the film well.Give it a shot! But fair warning, it is cheesy sci-fi."

I love how AI in the future takes over everything but it also gives leeway that AI may be something that will help humanity if humanity evolves to this level I think the planet Earth will be very exciting to say the least. And it could be that I am a Trekkie since the first Star Trek and this takes Syfy to a new level for me."
"","More of the same Ol with Jloooooo","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9810835/?ref_=tt_urv","chryst7","27 May 2024","""Atlas,"" starring Jennifer Lopez, is a disappointing sci-fi adventure that fails to deliver. I felt like i was watch a telenovela that was translated into english! He film is bogged down by a weak script and uninspired direction. Over emphesizing her lines like they do on Telemundo! The plot, revolving around an AI threatening humanity, is predictable and lacks depth. The characters are one-dimensional, and the dialogue is often cringeworthy. The special effects, while occasionally impressive, can't compensate for the lack of originality and suspense. Overall, ""Atlas"" is a forgettable entry in Lopez's filmography and a missed opportunity for compelling sci-fi storytelling.I think Smith the AI was more entertaining......."
"","Wrong casting","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9808266/?ref_=tt_urv","medate","25 May 2024","Atlas is not a bad movie that deserves its current score on IMDB, on the contrary, we can say that it is a fluent and enjoyable science fiction movie. However, I can understand the low score and I think the most important reason for this is Jennifer Lopez. She is not cast at all for the role she plays. If Emily Blunt or any other actor or actress had played the role, I don't think the movie would have received such a negative reaction. Nevertheless, in the end, despite some shallow elements in the script and the wrong casting, it is a fun, fluent and watchable science fiction movie. My rating: 7/10."

I haven't watched it tbh - and no intention to watch. I saw the drinker summary, prob way better than the actual movie.J Lo as an Action star? Simu Liu as a bad guy? The script was probably written by ChatGPT 3 from what I have seen and heard so far. ChatGPT 4 would def have made a better script than those idiots. No wonder they went on strike. WTF.And I am really confused. Who green lights these projects? And why? Is the talent pool so small and the demand for ""content"" so high, that they can squander $100m for obvious fails like this?Or really nobody cares anymore?And this one you can't really blame on diversity hires or so, it is just utterly bad.And Netflix presents this is No. 1 ""in my country"". Really? Why don't I believe you?"
